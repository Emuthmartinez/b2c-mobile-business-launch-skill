/**
 * seed-design-brief
 *
 * Advisory seeder for state.designBrief. It derives a ui-ux-pro-max query from the
 * current Design Room state and prints a designBrief skeleton to adapt. It does NOT
 * call any external skill and does NOT mutate state unless `--write` is passed AND
 * no designBrief exists yet. The agent fills the brief from ui-ux-pro-max output
 * (reference-only: adapt its guidance, do not paste its data) then versions/renders.
