# Emotional Experience Measurement

Use this when instrumenting the four named emotional-experience cards (Commitment Card, Variable Reward Card, Perceived Effort Delay Card, Intent Mirroring Card) so that "emotional experience" produces falsifiable PostHog signal, not vibes. Load this alongside `analytics-attribution.md`, `eleven-star-experience.md`, and `onboarding-conversion.md`. Do NOT duplicate event names from `analytics-attribution.md` — extend them.

The goal: every emotional moment must be traceable from a named PostHog event → a behavioral metric it moves → a counter-metric that reveals misuse → an A/B test that isolates causation.

## 1. Scope And Governance

These cards are NOT dark patterns by design. Each card has a bright-line rule. The skill's compliance veto fires and blocks implementation if the dark-line is crossed. When in doubt, default to the bright line.

| Card | Bright Line (Serves User's Real Goal) | Dark Line (Compliance Veto) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Commitment Card | User explicitly chose and progressed; the app reflects that back honestly | Manufactured false progress; lock-in without delivered value; manufactured loss through guilt |
| Variable Reward Card | Reward timing is honest and the user can opt out | Suppressed rewards to re-trigger distress; infinite scroll without exit; withdrawal-inducing withdrawal patterns |
| Perceived Effort Delay Card | Delay reflects real computation or care; user can cancel; accuracy stated | Fake progress bars with random delays; no user benefit from the wait |
| Intent Mirroring Card | Pause confirms the user's stated intent and offers a path forward | Pause adds friction to exit/cancel; pause used to dissuade unsubscribe |

Add a failure card `emotional-card-dark-line-crossed` whenever a dark-line violation is detected (see Section 12).

## 2. Psychological Grounding

Attribute every claim to its source. Do not invent citations.

- **Commitment and consistency / foot-in-the-door**: Robert Cialdini, _Influence_ (1984). Small prior commitments increase follow-through on larger ones. The Commitment Card creates a visible micro-investment moment so the user's own choices create forward momentum.
- **Dopamine reward-prediction-error / anticipation-not-reward**: Wolfram Schultz, "A Neural Substrate of Prediction and Reward," _Science_ 275 (1997). Dopamine fires on the anticipation signal, not the reward delivery. The Variable Reward Card exploits the build-up phase, not the dopamine of the prize itself.
- **Variable-ratio reinforcement schedule**: B.F. Skinner, operant conditioning research. Unpredictable reward timing produces stronger and more persistent response than fixed intervals. Bright-line: variability must be genuine, not simulated.
- **Labor Illusion / operational transparency**: Ryan Buell and Michael Norton, "The Labor Illusion: How Operational Transparency Increases Perceived Value," _Management Science_ (2011). Users value outcomes more when they can see effort expended on their behalf. The Perceived Effort Delay Card operationalizes this.
- **IKEA effect**: Norton, Mochon, and Ariely, "The IKEA Effect: When Labor Leads to Love," _Journal of Consumer Psychology_ (2012). Users place higher value on outcomes they participate in creating. Perceived Effort Delay elevates this when users see the system working through their specific inputs.
- **Implementation intentions**: Peter Gollwitzer, "Implementation Intentions: Strong Effects of Simple Plans," _American Psychologist_ (1999). Stating when/where you will do something significantly increases follow-through. The Intent Mirroring Card makes a user's stated intention explicit and specific.
- **Goal-gradient effect / endowed progress**: Clark Hull (1932); Kivetz, Urminsky, and Zheng, "The Goal-Gradient Hypothesis Resurrected," _Journal of Marketing Research_ (2006). Users accelerate effort as they approach a goal, especially when shown they have already made progress.
- **Wanting-vs-liking dissociation**: Kent Berridge, motivational neuroscience. "Wanting" (incentive salience) and "liking" (hedonic pleasure) are distinct systems. The Variable Reward Card targets wanting; dark patterns suppress liking to inflate wanting, which is a compliance veto.
- **Peak-end rule**: Daniel Kahneman and Barbara Fredrickson, "When More Pain Is Preferred to Less," _Psychological Science_ (1993). Users remember an experience by its peak emotion and its ending. Intent Mirroring creates a designed peak.
- **Hook Model (Trigger → Action → Variable Reward → Investment)**: Nir Eyal, _Hooked_ (2014). Each card maps to one segment of this loop. The Investment phase (what the user puts in) is where Commitment Card lives. Variable Reward is its own explicit loop phase.
- **Fogg Behavior Model (B = MAP)**: BJ Fogg, _Tiny Habits_ (2019). Behavior = Motivation × Ability × Prompt. Emotional cards work on the Motivation axis; they must not manufacture fake Ability signals (a dark-line).
- **Visceral/behavioral/reflective design**: Don Norman, _Emotional Design_ (2004). The three levels map roughly: Variable Reward (visceral), Perceived Effort Delay (behavioral), Intent Mirroring (reflective).
- **Affective computing / sensing user state**: Rosalind Picard, _Affective Computing_ (1997). Attribution-uncertain: no specific study cited; principle is that emotional context changes user receptivity. Used as rationale for timing cards to positive states, not distress.
- **Fresh-start effect**: Hengchen Dai, Katherine Milkman, and Jason Riis, "The Fresh Start Effect," _Management Science_ (2014). Temporal landmarks increase motivation. Commitment Card timing at natural restart moments amplifies the effect.

## 3. System-Level Measurement Layer

### 3a. System Events

These events fire once per emotional-card firing and are additional to the base catalog in `analytics-attribution.md`.

| Event | Trigger | Required Properties | Privacy Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `emotion_card_fired` | Any of the four cards activates | `card_id` (one of: `commitment`, `variable_reward`, `perceived_effort_delay`, `intent_mirroring`), `surface`, `screen_id`, `flow_id`, `step_id`, `variant_id`, `session_id`, `user_has_prior_value` (bool) | No user-content fields |
| `emotion_card_completed` | User advances past the card's moment without rage-tap or abandon | Same as `emotion_card_fired` plus `completion_latency_ms` | None |
| `emotion_card_abandoned` | User exits the flow during or immediately after the card fires | Same plus `abandon_reason` (timeout / back / close / rage_tap), `rage_tap_detected` (bool) | None |
| `emotion_card_opt_out` | User explicitly disables an emotional feature (e.g. turns off streaks, disables notifications) | `card_id`, `opt_out_surface`, `opt_out_reason_shown` (bool) | None |

### 3b. System-Level North-Star Metrics

| Metric | Direction | Threshold To Investigate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Activation rate (first core action) | Up | |
| D1 / D7 / D30 retention | Up | |
| Paywall conversion rate | Up | |
| App Review prompt acceptance rate | Up | |
| `emotion_card_abandoned` rate per card | Down | > 15 % per card → review |
| Rage-tap rate during card moments | Down | > 3 % → immediate review |
| Notification disable rate (7-day cohort) | Down | > 20 % → review |
| Uninstall rate (D3 cohort) | Down | |
| Refund/cancel rate (D7 cohort) | Down | |
| Negative review rate ("addictive" / "manipulative" text) | Down | Any mention → triage |

### 3c. System-Level A/B Experiment Template

Use a PostHog feature flag named `exp_emotion_system_<app_slug>_<YYYYMM>`. Expose flag at first `app_opened` event. Track `emotion_card_fired` as exposure event. Primary metric: `activation_task_completed`. Counter-metric: `emotion_card_abandoned` with `rage_tap_detected = true`.

Minimum detectable effect: 5 % relative lift on activation before claiming a card works.

## 4. Commitment Card Measurement

### Psychological Basis

Robert Cialdini commitment and consistency. Nir Eyal Hook Model Investment phase. BJ Fogg B=MAP (prior micro-commitment raises motivation for the next action). Goal-gradient effect (Kivetz, Urminsky, Zheng): once a user has made even a small commitment, framing future actions as continuation rather than new effort increases completion.

### What The Card Does

A micro-choice or micro-investment moment that the app visibly acknowledges. The user names a goal, picks a preference, sets a first parameter, or completes a tiny first step — and the app echoes it back prominently before asking for payment or sustained effort. The key mechanic: the user's own words and choices appear in the UI, creating consistency pressure.

### (a) PostHog Events

| Event | When It Fires | Required Properties |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `commitment_card_initiated` | User is shown the commitment-capture UI (goal-setting, first-choice, pledge, or onboarding answer that will be mirrored back) | `commitment_type` (`goal` / `preference` / `pledge` / `first_action`), `surface`, `flow_id`, `step_id`, `variant_id` |
| `commitment_captured` | User submits their commitment input (typed goal, selected option, completed micro-step) | Same as above plus `commitment_input_type` (`text` / `selection` / `action`), `commitment_length_chars` (for text; no raw text), `has_prior_session_commitment` (bool) |
| `commitment_echo_shown` | App displays the commitment back to the user (e.g. "Your goal: run 3x/week" on paywall or activation screen) | `commitment_type`, `echo_surface` (paywall / activation / dashboard / notification), `variant_id` |
| `commitment_echo_engaged` | User taps or interacts with the echoed commitment (expands, edits, shares) | Same as above plus `engagement_type` |
| `commitment_reinforced` | App surfaces the commitment again at a later session (streak screen, return notification body, lifecycle email subject) | `commitment_type`, `session_number`, `days_since_capture`, `channel` (`push` / `in_app` / `email`) |

### (b) Leading Behavioral Metrics

| Metric | How Commitment Card Should Move It | Funnel Step |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `onboarding_completed` rate | Up — commitment echo on the paywall gives a reason to continue | Onboarding → paywall |
| `paywall_viewed` → `trial_started` or `purchase_completed` | Up — echo increases personal relevance of paywall offer | Paywall conversion |
| D1 retention | Up — prior commitment creates fresh-start return motivation | D1 return session |
| `activation_task_completed` | Up — goal-gradient effect: user has "already started" | First-session activation |
| Streak length (median days) | Up — reinforced commitment reduces streak abandonment | Retention |

Person property to set after `commitment_captured`: `commitment_type`, `commitment_captured_at`, `commitment_flow_id`. These properties allow cohort analysis: do users who captured a commitment retain better?

### (c) Counter-Metrics (Dark-Pattern Backfire Signals)

| Counter-Metric | What It Reveals | Threshold |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `commitment_card_abandoned` rate | Users bail when they see a commitment being extracted, not freely given | > 20 % abandon during capture step → review copy/framing |
| `emotion_card_opt_out` where `card_id = commitment` | Users actively turning off commitment features (e.g. "don't remind me of my goal") | > 10 % of activated users |
| Negative review text containing "guilt" / "nag" / "shame" | Commitment reinforcement perceived as manipulation | Any cluster → design review |
| Cancel/refund event within 24 h of `commitment_echo_shown` | Echo felt like a lock-in trap | Spike > baseline → review |
| `rage_tap_detected = true` during `commitment_echo_shown` | User frustrated by the echo surface | > 2 % |

### (d) A/B Experiment Design

**Flag key**: `exp_commitment_echo_<app_slug>_<YYYYMM>`

| Variant | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `control` | Standard onboarding and paywall — no explicit commitment capture or echo |
| `commitment_echo_paywall` | Commitment captured in onboarding; echoed on paywall screen before price |
| `commitment_echo_activation` | Commitment captured; echoed on first activation task screen, not paywall |

**Exposure event**: `commitment_card_initiated`

**Primary metric**: `trial_started` or `purchase_completed` within the session

**Secondary metric**: D7 retention cohort

**Counter-metric**: `emotion_card_abandoned` with `abandon_reason = rage_tap` during or within 60 s of `commitment_echo_shown`

**Guardrail**: If counter-metric exceeds 3 % OR negative review cluster appears within 14 days, halt experiment, flag the `emotional-card-dark-line-crossed` failure card, and require a design review before re-enabling.

## 5. Variable Reward Card Measurement

### Psychological Basis

B.F. Skinner variable-ratio reinforcement. Wolfram Schultz dopamine reward-prediction-error (1997): the dopamine response peaks at the _anticipation_ signal, not the delivery. Nir Eyal Hook Model Variable Reward phase: rewards of tribe (social recognition), hunt (resources, content), and self (mastery, progress). Kent Berridge wanting-vs-liking: the card must produce genuine liking, not just wanting — maximizing wanting alone while suppressing liking is a compliance veto.

### What The Card Does

A moment of deliberate anticipation before a reward is revealed. The user takes a triggering action, then there is a brief designed uncertainty window (visual suspense, "unlocking" animation, "processing your results") before the reward appears. The reward itself varies in magnitude or form on a genuine, not manufactured, variable schedule.

### (a) PostHog Events

| Event | When It Fires | Required Properties |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `variable_reward_trigger` | User takes the action that initiates the variable-reward loop (e.g. completes a session, submits content, finishes a challenge) | `reward_pool_id` (which pool of possible rewards), `trigger_action`, `surface`, `flow_id`, `variant_id` |
| `variable_reward_anticipation_start` | Anticipation UI begins (countdown, animation, "calculating," "unlocking") | `anticipation_duration_ms` (target), `animation_type`, `reduce_motion_active` (bool) |
| `variable_reward_revealed` | Reward is shown to user | `reward_type` (tribal / hunt / self / streak / badge / content / discount / feature_unlock), `reward_rarity` (`common` / `uncommon` / `rare`), `anticipation_actual_duration_ms`, `is_reduced_motion_fallback` (bool) |
| `variable_reward_engaged` | User taps, shares, or further interacts with the reward | `reward_type`, `engagement_action` (`shared` / `saved` / `viewed` / `dismissed`) |
| `variable_reward_dismissed` | User closes or skips the reward without engagement | `reward_type`, `time_to_dismiss_ms` |
| `variable_reward_opt_out` | User turns off reward animations or reward notifications | `opt_out_channel` (`animation` / `notification` / `feature`) |

### (b) Leading Behavioral Metrics

| Metric | How Variable Reward Card Should Move It | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| D1 / D7 return rate | Up — anticipation creates a "what will I get tomorrow?" pull | Schultz: anticipation primes next-session return |
| `core_action_completed` frequency (sessions per week) | Up — variable schedule drives more triggering actions | Skinner variable-ratio |
| Share rate (`share_completed`) | Up — reward-of-tribe payoffs create social sharing | Eyal tribe reward |
| `activation_task_completed` in first session | Up — first reward reveal in onboarding elevates activation | |
| Streak length (median) | Up — streak itself is a variable-reward delivery channel | |

Person property to set: `last_reward_type_received`, `reward_reveals_total`, `highest_reward_rarity_seen`. These allow personalization: adjust reward pool composition for users who have plateaued.

### (c) Counter-Metrics (Dark-Pattern Backfire Signals)

| Counter-Metric | What It Reveals | Threshold |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `variable_reward_opt_out` rate | Users actively suppressing the mechanic | > 15 % → review mechanic design |
| `variable_reward_dismissed` with `time_to_dismiss_ms < 500` | Reward felt like an interruption, not a moment | > 25 % dismissals under 0.5 s → reduce intrusion |
| Uninstall rate cohorted on `reward_reveals_total = 0` vs. high-reveal users | If uninstall is highest in zero-reveal cohort → OK; if highest in high-reveal cohort → mechanic driving churn | |
| `notification_disabled` event within 48 h of first reward notification | Push notification felt like an extraction, not an invitation | > 25 % |
| Negative review text: "addictive" / "gambling" / "slot machine" | Variability perceived as extraction | Any cluster → design review |
| `rage_tap_detected = true` during anticipation window | Anticipation phase too long or deceptive | > 2 % |
| Refund/cancel within 24 h of `variable_reward_revealed` where `reward_rarity = rare` | User felt rare reward gated real value, not extra value | Spike → review |

### (d) A/B Experiment Design

**Flag key**: `exp_variable_reward_<app_slug>_<YYYYMM>`

| Variant | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `control` | Fixed, predictable reward on every triggering action |
| `variable_low` | Variable reward with a narrow range (2 tiers: common / uncommon) |
| `variable_full` | Variable reward with a wide range (3 tiers: common / uncommon / rare), with anticipation animation |

**Exposure event**: `variable_reward_trigger`

**Primary metric**: `core_action_completed` rate over next 7 days (session frequency)

**Secondary metric**: D7 retention, share rate

**Counter-metric**: `variable_reward_opt_out` rate AND `notification_disabled` rate in the 48 h cohort

**Guardrail**: If opt-out rate in `variable_full` exceeds `variable_low` by more than 10 percentage points, OR if "slot machine" / "addictive" appears in App Store reviews within 14 days, halt the experiment and file `emotional-card-dark-line-crossed`.

## 6. Perceived Effort Delay Card Measurement

### Psychological Basis

Ryan Buell and Michael Norton, "The Labor Illusion," _Management Science_ (2011): users value results more — and rate service quality higher — when they can observe effort. Norton, Mochon, and Ariely IKEA effect (2012): participation in creation raises perceived value. Peter Gollwitzer implementation intentions: if the user sees the system working through _their specific inputs_, the result feels like it belongs to them. Attribution-uncertain: several 2019–2024 mobile UX studies show progress visibility reduces churn during AI-generation waits; exact authors not confirmed.

### What The Card Does

A visible, narrated processing moment that communicates _what the system is doing for this specific user_. Not a generic spinner — a personalized effort signal: "Analyzing your sleep patterns from last week…" "Building your plan based on your 3 goals…". The delay must reflect real computation (or real care in composition). Fake delays with no underlying computation are a dark-line violation.

### (a) PostHog Events

| Event | When It Fires | Required Properties |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `effort_delay_started` | Personalized processing UI begins | `surface`, `flow_id`, `step_id`, `computation_type` (`real_api_call` / `real_data_processing` / `ui_composition`), `user_inputs_referenced_count` (how many of the user's prior inputs are displayed), `target_duration_ms`, `variant_id` |
| `effort_delay_step_shown` | Each narration step ("Analyzing your pace…", "Calibrating intensity…") is displayed | `step_index`, `step_copy_key` (stable key, not raw copy), `inputs_personalized` (bool) |
| `effort_delay_completed` | Processing UI ends and result is revealed | `actual_duration_ms`, `steps_shown`, `user_cancelled` (bool), `reduce_motion_active` (bool) |
| `effort_delay_cancelled` | User cancels during the delay | `time_to_cancel_ms`, `step_at_cancel` |
| `effort_delay_result_engaged` | User interacts with the revealed result (saves, shares, starts using) | `result_type`, `time_to_first_engagement_ms` |
| `effort_delay_result_dismissed` | User closes the result without engagement | `time_to_dismiss_ms` |

### (b) Leading Behavioral Metrics

| Metric | How Perceived Effort Delay Should Move It | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `onboarding_completed` rate | Up — personalized plan reveal with visible effort reduces mid-onboarding drop | Labor Illusion |
| `paywall_viewed` → `trial_started` | Up — user values the plan more when they watched it being built | IKEA effect on plan valuation |
| `activation_task_completed` in first session | Up — user is invested in the result the system built for them | Implementation intentions |
| D7 retention | Up — users return to "their plan" not "the plan" | |
| Paywall conversion on second visit (soft paywall apps) | Up — effort signal raises perceived cost of not subscribing | |

Person property to set: `plan_built_at`, `plan_inputs_count`, `plan_effort_steps_seen`. Allows cohort: users who saw more personalized effort steps vs. generic spinner.

### (c) Counter-Metrics (Dark-Pattern Backfire Signals)

| Counter-Metric | What It Reveals | Threshold |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `effort_delay_cancelled` rate | Delay is too long or users sense it is fake | > 10 % → reduce duration or add cancel affordance |
| `effort_delay_result_dismissed` with `time_to_dismiss_ms < 1000` | Result did not feel worth the wait | > 20 % → review result quality and copy |
| Rage-tap during `effort_delay_started` or step transitions | Animation / pacing causing frustration | > 2 % |
| `refund_detected` or `subscription_cancelled` within 48 h of `effort_delay_completed` where `computation_type = ui_composition` | User discovered delay was cosmetic, felt deceived | Any spike → compliance review; may warrant removing that computation_type |
| Support contact (`support_contact_clicked`) cohorted to users whose `effort_delay_actual_duration_ms > target + 3000` | Real computation taking too long, users assume failure | > 5 % → add timeout fallback |
| Negative review text: "fake" / "just a spinner" / "doesn't actually analyze" | Labor illusion perceived as manipulation | Any cluster → design review |

### (d) A/B Experiment Design

**Flag key**: `exp_effort_delay_<app_slug>_<YYYYMM>`

| Variant | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `control` | Generic loading spinner, no personalized narration |
| `personalized_steps` | Narrated steps that reference user's own inputs (e.g. their named goal, their answer count) |
| `personalized_steps_with_count` | Same as above plus a visible progress count or percentage |

**Exposure event**: `effort_delay_started`

**Primary metric**: `paywall_viewed` → `trial_started` or `purchase_completed` conversion within the same session

**Secondary metric**: `activation_task_completed` rate within first session

**Counter-metric**: `effort_delay_cancelled` rate AND `effort_delay_result_dismissed` (< 1 s) rate

**Guardrail**: If `computation_type = ui_composition` and cancel rate exceeds 10 % in any variant, halt, set computation_type to `real_api_call` only or reduce duration, file failure card.

---

## 7. Intent Mirroring Card Measurement

### Psychological Basis

Peter Gollwitzer implementation intentions (1999): making an intention explicit — "I will do X at time T in situation S" — dramatically increases follow-through vs. a vague goal. Daniel Kahneman and Barbara Fredrickson peak-end rule (1993): a well-designed moment of reflective pause becomes the emotional peak that the user remembers. Don Norman reflective design (_Emotional Design_, 2004): the reflective level of design creates meaning, self-image, and memory. Robert Cialdini commitment and consistency: an explicit stated intent increases behavioral follow-through. Goal-directed design (Alan Cooper): designing for user goals, not features, means pausing to surface what the user is _trying to accomplish_.

### What The Card Does

A deliberate, brief pause at a high-stakes moment (pre-purchase, first core action, goal milestone, return after absence) where the app reflects the user's stated intent back to them in the user's own language. The pause is not a barrier — it is a confirmation that turns a transactional click into a meaningful moment. Examples: "You said you want to sleep better. Starting your first sleep session now." / "You're about to commit to your 7-day plan. Ready?" The user can proceed, edit their intent, or step back — all three paths are valid.

### (a) PostHog Events

| Event | When It Fires | Required Properties |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `intent_mirror_shown` | Intent mirroring UI is displayed | `surface` (pre_purchase / pre_first_action / milestone / re_engagement), `intent_type` (user's intent category, not raw text), `intent_source` (`onboarding_answer` / `user_set_goal` / `prior_session_action`), `mirror_copy_key` (stable key), `variant_id` |
| `intent_mirror_confirmed` | User taps the primary CTA (proceed, yes, start, commit) | `intent_type`, `time_to_confirm_ms` |
| `intent_mirror_edited` | User taps "edit my goal" or equivalent to revise their intent before proceeding | `intent_type`, `edit_surface` |
| `intent_mirror_dismissed` | User closes without confirming (back / close / timeout) | `intent_type`, `dismiss_reason` (`back` / `close` / `timeout`), `time_to_dismiss_ms` |
| `intent_mirror_re_engagement` | Intent mirror used for a return session after N-day absence | `days_absent`, `intent_type`, `session_number` |

### (b) Leading Behavioral Metrics

| Metric | How Intent Mirroring Should Move It | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `trial_started` or `purchase_completed` immediately after `intent_mirror_confirmed` | Up — the mirror reframes purchase as "honoring my own intent" | Cialdini commitment |
| `activation_task_completed` after first intent mirror | Up — implementation intention created in-product | Gollwitzer |
| D7 / D30 retention for users who received a return-session mirror | Up — the pause creates a memorable peak | Kahneman peak-end |
| Review prompt acceptance rate (`review_prompt_continued` / `review_prompt_requested`) | Up — if mirror fires just before the native review prompt | Peak-end effect raises willingness to rate positively |
| `share_completed` rate for users who received a milestone mirror | Up — peak moment primes sharing | |

Person property to set: `intent_mirror_received_at`, `intent_mirror_count`, `intent_type_mirrored`. Allows cohort: users who received mirroring vs. not, and whether the intent type correlates with retention.

### (c) Counter-Metrics (Dark-Pattern Backfire Signals)

| Counter-Metric | What It Reveals | Threshold |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `intent_mirror_dismissed` rate with `surface = pre_purchase` | Mirror used as a purchase-pressure dark pattern; users resist | > 30 % dismiss → investigate if dismiss path is being suppressed |
| `intent_mirror_dismissed` rate with `surface = re_engagement` | Return mirror feels like guilt-tripping, not a welcome back | > 25 % → rewrite copy, make it warmer and lower-stakes |
| `emotion_card_opt_out` where `card_id = intent_mirroring` | Users explicitly disabling intent-mirror moments | > 10 % → mirror is intrusive |
| Rage-tap during `intent_mirror_shown` | Pause is blocking, not meaningful | > 3 % → shorten or make interaction lighter |
| `subscription_cancelled` within 24 h of `intent_mirror_shown` where `surface = pre_purchase` | Mirror on the cancel path is perceived as guilt trap | Any spike → remove from cancel/offboarding path; it belongs on value paths only |
| Negative review text: "manipulative" / "won't let me cancel" / "guilt" | Mirror used on exit paths, not value paths | Any cluster → immediate review |
| `paywall_dismissed` immediately after `intent_mirror_dismissed` (same session) | Mirror is deterring purchase, not motivating it | If > 50 % of mirror-dismissed users also dismiss paywall → mirror is backfiring |

### (d) A/B Experiment Design

**Flag key**: `exp_intent_mirror_<app_slug>_<YYYYMM>`

| Variant | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `control` | Standard pre-purchase or pre-activation screen with no intent echo |
| `intent_mirror_generic` | Mirror that shows a generic category statement ("Reach your fitness goals") |
| `intent_mirror_personal` | Mirror that uses the user's own language from their onboarding answer |

**Exposure event**: `intent_mirror_shown`

**Primary metric**: `trial_started` or `purchase_completed` within the session (for `surface = pre_purchase`); `activation_task_completed` within the session (for `surface = pre_first_action`)

**Secondary metric**: D7 retention for the cohort

**Counter-metric**: `intent_mirror_dismissed` rate AND rage-tap rate during `intent_mirror_shown`

**Guardrail**: If `intent_mirror_personal` dismiss rate exceeds `control` baseline by more than 15 percentage points, the personal mirroring copy is backfiring. Halt, review copy, check that intent data is accurate (not stale or generic), re-run with corrected copy before re-enabling.

## 8. Cross-Card Dashboard

Create a PostHog dashboard named "Emotional Experience — Card Signals." Include the following insights:

| Insight Name | Type | Definition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Card Fire Rate By Surface | Trend line | `emotion_card_fired` count, broken down by `card_id`, daily |
| Card Completion vs. Abandon | Funnel | `emotion_card_fired` → `emotion_card_completed` / `emotion_card_abandoned`, broken down by `card_id` |
| Rage-Tap Rate By Card | Trend line | `emotion_card_abandoned` where `rage_tap_detected = true`, by `card_id`, weekly |
| Opt-Out Rate By Card | Trend line | `emotion_card_opt_out` count / `emotion_card_fired` count, by `card_id`, weekly |
| Commitment → Paywall Conversion | Funnel | `commitment_captured` → `paywall_viewed` → `trial_started` or `purchase_completed` |
| Variable Reward → D7 Retention | Retention | Cohort by `variable_reward_trigger` (day 0), retention at D1/D3/D7 |
| Effort Delay → Activation | Funnel | `effort_delay_completed` → `activation_task_completed` within 10 min |
| Intent Mirror → Purchase | Funnel | `intent_mirror_shown` → `intent_mirror_confirmed` → `trial_started` or `purchase_completed` |
| Dark-Pattern Watch | Trend | `emotion_card_abandoned` where `abandon_reason = rage_tap` + `notification_disabled` (48-h cohort) + `subscription_cancelled` within 24 h of any card fire. Weekly. Alert if any metric exceeds threshold. |

Dashboard description should state: "This dashboard is the audit surface. If any metric in Dark-Pattern Watch exceeds its threshold for two consecutive weeks, file `emotional-card-dark-line-crossed` and pause the relevant card variant."

## 9. Dark-Pattern Detection Protocol

Run this protocol weekly while any emotional card experiment is active. Record results in `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` under `lanes.emotional_design.dark_pattern_watch`.

1. Pull the "Dark-Pattern Watch" dashboard for the past 7 days.
2. For each card, check all counter-metrics against their thresholds (Sections 4c, 5c, 6c, 7c).
3. Run an App Store review text scan for cluster terms: "addictive," "manipulative," "gambling," "guilt," "shame," "fake," "slot machine," "can't cancel," "won't let me," "trapped."
4. If any threshold is breached OR any text cluster appears with ≥ 3 reviews: open the `emotional-card-dark-line-crossed` failure card (Section 12), pause the triggering experiment variant, notify the founder.
5. If all clear: record date and sign-off in `PROJECT_STATE.yaml`. Close any open watch cards.
6. If a card has been paused for ≥ 14 days with no resolution, escalate to a design review. Do not silently re-enable paused variants.

## 10. Ethics Guardrails And Compliance Veto

The following actions are hard-blocked. Any agent proposing them must be stopped, the action logged in `FAILURE_CARDS.md`, and the founder notified before any code ships.

| Blocked Action | Which Card | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Manufacturing fake commitment progress (showing progress bars that do not reflect real user actions) | Commitment | Cialdini bright-line: the commitment must be real, not simulated |
| Suppressing a legitimate cancel or back action during a commitment echo or intent mirror moment | Commitment, Intent Mirroring | Dark pattern: reducing ability to exit is manipulation, not design |
| Showing a variable-ratio reward mechanic on content the user has already seen, to create false novelty | Variable Reward | Berridge wanting-vs-liking: manufactured wanting without liking is extraction |
| Using a variable reward reveal to gate access to content that was already earned | Variable Reward | Skinner bright-line: variable timing is about schedule, not withholding earned value |
| Adding artificial processing delays beyond what real computation requires, with no user benefit | Perceived Effort Delay | Labor Illusion bright-line: the visible effort must reflect real effort (Buell & Norton) |
| Placing an intent mirror on a cancel / unsubscribe / downgrade flow to add friction | Intent Mirroring | Norman reflective design: mirrors are for amplifying value, not blocking exit |
| Removing the opt-out or edit path from any emotional card UI | All cards | GDPR/consumer protection baseline; Fogg B=MAP: ability to stop must exist |
| Firing any card in a distressed user state (e.g. after three failed payment attempts, after an error screen) | All cards | Affective computing principle (Picard): emotional design at distress points is exploitation |

## 11. Implementation And QA Checklist

Add these checks to the standard analytics QA from `analytics-attribution.md`.

- All four card-level events (`emotion_card_fired`, `emotion_card_completed`, `emotion_card_abandoned`, `emotion_card_opt_out`) appear in PostHog activity on a test run of each card.
- `card_id` values are stable string constants defined in a typed enum or constant file — not inline strings.
- `reduce_motion_active` property is set correctly by reading OS-level reduce-motion preference before firing `variable_reward_anticipation_start` and `effort_delay_started`. Verify the fallback animation (or no animation) renders when reduce-motion is on.
- Opt-out paths exist in the UI for each card where the user can disable the mechanic. Verify `emotion_card_opt_out` fires when used.
- No emotional card fires on error screens, payment failure screens, or cancel/unsubscribe flows. Verify with a code audit before any experiment is enabled.
- Each card's computation_type is documented and verified: Perceived Effort Delay steps reference only real computation or real UI composition, not arbitrary sleep timers.
- The "Dark-Pattern Watch" dashboard exists in PostHog before any card experiment goes live.
- A/B experiment flags are gated: control variant is always the safe baseline; no experiment ships without a counter-metric alert configured in PostHog.
- `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` `lanes.emotional_design` includes `status`, `evidence`, `active_experiments`, and `dark_pattern_watch.last_reviewed_at` fields.

Run:

```bash
npm run check:analytics -- --root .
```

Verify `emotion_card_fired` and at least one card-specific event appear in the event catalog section of `ANALYTICS.md`.

## 12. Failure Card Shape

Use this shape when a dark-pattern signal is detected. Store in `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` and mirror in `FAILURE_CARDS.md` when the launch is large.

```yaml
id: "emotional-card-dark-line-crossed"
severity: "critical"
owner: "product-lead"
status: "open"
detected_at: "YYYY-MM-DD"
evidence:
  - "PostHog dashboard: Emotional Experience — Card Signals"
  - "Counter-metric breached: <metric name> at <value> vs threshold <threshold>"
  - "App Store review cluster: <sample text if applicable>"
impact: "Emotional card variant is producing user resistance, perceived manipulation, or extraction behavior. Experiment paused. No re-enable until design review completes."
next_action: "Pause the triggering experiment variant. Notify founder. Conduct a design review against the bright-line rules in emotional-experience-measurement.md Section 1. Revise copy or mechanic, re-test in a controlled cohort before re-enabling."
validator: "npm run check:analytics -- --root . && PostHog dark-pattern-watch dashboard all-clear for 14 consecutive days"
```

Additionally, use this shape for a missing measurement layer:

```yaml
id: "emotional-card-measurement-missing"
severity: "high"
owner: "engineering-leader"
status: "open"
detected_at: "YYYY-MM-DD"
evidence:
  - "emotion_card_fired event absent from PostHog activity"
impact: "Emotional card is live without instrumentation. Dark-pattern signals cannot be detected. Analytics audit produces no evidence."
next_action: "Implement all four system events (emotion_card_fired, emotion_card_completed, emotion_card_abandoned, emotion_card_opt_out) and at least the primary event for each active card before any experiment flag is enabled."
validator: "npm run check:analytics -- --root . shows emotion_card_fired in ANALYTICS.md event catalog"
```
