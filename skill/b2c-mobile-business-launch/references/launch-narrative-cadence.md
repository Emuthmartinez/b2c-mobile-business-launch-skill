# Launch Narrative & Cadence

Use this reference when planning how a B2C mobile launch shows up in public: the tentpole
announcement, the weekly feature-launch heartbeat, the launch-day run-of-show, and the copy
craft that decides whether a release lands or dies on arrival. It produces
[`growth/LAUNCH_NARRATIVE.md`](../templates/growth/LAUNCH_NARRATIVE.md) and is enforced by
`npm run check:launch-narrative`.

It is a peer reference to [`viral-growth-loops.md`](viral-growth-loops.md) (in-product sharing
loops), [`ugc-creator-engine.md`](ugc-creator-engine.md) (creator-led organic), [`paid-user-acquisition.md`](paid-user-acquisition.md)
(paid amplification), [`remotion-content-assets.md`](remotion-content-assets.md) (the hero video and
post assets), [`emotional-design-system.md`](emotional-design-system.md) (the feeling the launch
must carry), and [`aso-store-ops.md`](aso-store-ops.md) (the store launch calendar). Do not
duplicate those; cross-reference them.

## Why This Lane Exists

The fastest-growing consumer-AI companies treat **every release as an event** and run a
**deliberate cadence**, so they are always in the conversation. That is a system, not luck —
each beat is planned weeks out, down to post order and who replies to what. This reference
encodes that system so a launch package ships with a real narrative and cadence instead of a
pretty 30-second animation and a blog post written the day before.

The core reframe: **a launch is not the end of building a product; it is the reason to build it
a certain way.** Use rare big moments to earn a standing audience, then feed that audience so it
never goes cold.

## Evidence Base (and what is NOT verified)

This lane is informed by a specific NYC launch agency and by public launches it and its peers
ran. Keep the verifiable facts; do not repeat the marketing claims.

- **Shown Media** ([shownmedia.com](https://shownmedia.com), [shownmedia.com/tech](https://shownmedia.com/tech))
  is a NYC creative agency that runs viral go-to-market launches for tech/AI and DTC brands.
  Its public thesis: "we turn companies into internet moments," "going viral is skill based,"
  reverse-engineer the X/LinkedIn algorithms (sourcing signals + reply chains), a **4–6 week**
  launch process (Week 1 scripting/positioning; Weeks 2–6 production + revision), and a stated
  outcome band of roughly **2–10M views with a ~48-hour peak** before decline. A founder, Mitchell
  Rusitzky, surfaces this playbook publicly. The agency also describes a Claude Code multi-agent
  "script factory" (research phase sets the ceiling; specialist hook/body agents; a manager layer
  and a final quality gate) — "the system doesn't invent taste, it encodes it." See the
  [AI Corner profile](https://www.the-ai-corner.com/p/20-agent-ai-script-factory-10m-revenue).
  Shown has also published an operational **"X Launch Playbook & Checklist"** (six phases,
  summarized in [The Six-Phase X Launch Checklist](#the-six-phase-x-launch-checklist) below). Its
  headline figures (e.g. "100M+ views," "$1M+ in launch execution," a "2–3x" founder-reply uplift,
  "$50K+" amplification budgets) are agency-stated and must not be repeated as the launching
  company's own results.
- **Verified launch artifacts** (X impressions read off the live posts):
  - **Koji by Brilliant** — Sue Khim, [@suekhim, May 29 2026](https://x.com/suekhim/status/2060378988606878147),
    ~**4.71M** impressions. Hook: "AI is making kids dumber. It should be making them geniuses.
    Introducing Koji, the first AI tutor that gets kids to actually think." (See also Brilliant's
    [launch post](https://blog.brilliant.org/a-world-class-tutor-in-every-home/).) Textbook
    feeling-first copy: indictment → hopeful reframe → product, no hashtags, no emojis, no link in
    the post.
  - **Moda** — Anvisha Pai, [@anvisha funding launch, Mar 24 2026](https://x.com/anvisha/status/2036474296353411290),
    ~**4.50M** impressions. "We raised $7.5M to kill AI slop. Introducing Moda: the world's first
    design agent with taste." Note the optional engagement mechanic ("RT + comment 'Moda' and we'll
    design your brand for free") that manufactures reply/RT signals.
  - **ChatGPT feature post** — [@ChatGPTapp, May 22 2026](https://x.com/ChatGPTapp/status/2057908052968521902),
    ~**2.66M** impressions. "Paperwork is better when you can just talk through it…" — the model for a
    single small feature framed as a moment (the weekly heartbeat).
- **Do NOT repeat as fact** (could not be verified): any "MrBeast alumni" claim, a "10B+ views"
  figure, attributing an Emmy to the agency's CEO, the "many startups just died today" post, or the
  agency's self-reported aggregate view/revenue numbers (they are inconsistent across the agency's
  own pages). When writing a real launch's public copy, follow the skill rule that public claims are
  liabilities: cite only what is true and attributable.

## The Two Launch Types

Think in two buckets that feed each other.

### Tentpole Launch (the "Super Bowl")

Rare, expensive, planned weeks out. For ~48 hours you take over the timeline. It must feel special
and be backed by a heavy product moment (flagship feature/model, funding round, category-defining
repositioning). Prerequisites:

- **Genuine novelty + correct positioning.** Virality amplifies a real wedge; it does not
  manufacture one. If there is no heavy moment yet, do not fake a tentpole — run the heartbeat only.
- **Lead time of ~4–6 weeks** end to end. Do not expect a tentpole on a 3-day turnaround.
- **A credible human principal**, not the faceless brand handle. Koji = Sue Khim; Moda = Anvisha.
  The principal's face/voice is the trust anchor.
- **A hero asset** (video/clip) from [`content-assets/CONTENT_ASSETS.md`](../templates/content-assets/CONTENT_ASSETS.md)
  / `DEMO_VIDEO.md`.

### Feature Launch Cadence (the heartbeat)

Small, sharp, consistent releases packaged like events. This — not the tentpole — keeps you in the
conversation. Target a steady weekly beat of releases worth talking about (the @ChatGPTapp
"Paperwork" post is the model: one feature, framed as a moment, with a use-case hook).

### How they compound (Algorithm Compounding)

A tentpole does not end when the views stop. A meaningful slice of that reach keeps getting served
your posts for months — that is your **standing audience**. You stop fighting a cold start every
time you post, and the weekly heartbeat rides the wave of the last big moment. High cadence
compounds: an active account keeps getting re-served, and a long tail of each post's reach lands
days later via re-serve to that standing audience. (A "~10% long-tail" figure is a useful planning
heuristic, not a published number — label it as such.)

## Marketing At The Table

The companies that own attention flipped the usual order: instead of engineering shipping a feature
and handing marketing a day to "make it look good," **marketing has a say over what ships and when.**

- Hold a roadmap review with marketing in the room (monthly is a reasonable default).
- Pick the next release by what people will find interesting and what is trendy now — ship small,
  sharp releases against what is sitting in the zeitgeist this week. (Koji rode the "AI is making
  kids dumber / cheating" discourse; Moda rode "AI slop.")
- Treat sequencing and naming as partly a content calendar: every release should have a postable
  hook.

## Launch-Copy Craft

Most good companies fail here. The animation is clean and the product is fine, but the copy makes
you feel nothing — you read it, think "okay," and scroll. No reaction reads to the algorithm as no
value. **Shape every launch around a feeling first, the feature second.**

- **Lead with the emotional state or the broken status quo, then name the product/mechanism.**
  Koji: "AI is making kids dumber" (indictment) → "should be making them geniuses" (hope) → product.
  ChatGPT: "Paperwork is better when you can just talk through it" (use-case feeling) → feature.
- **A strong hook + POV is the whole game.** Have a thesis, name an enemy/broken thing, or reframe
  the category ("the first design agent *with taste*", "the first AI tutor that gets kids to
  *actually think*").
- **Emotional angles that work:** a glimmer of hope; pointing at something broken and saying we are
  fixing it; a genuinely new take that reframes the whole category.

### The 2026 DO-NOT-DO list (deterministically enforced)

`check:launch-narrative` scans the post copy (fenced code blocks in `LAUNCH_NARRATIVE.md`) for these:

- **No hashtags.** They read as marketing and depress reach.
- **No emojis carrying the message.** The verified high-performers use essentially none; let the
  hook and the video do the work.
- **No link in the main/root post.** Put the link in the first self-reply — off-platform links in
  the root post get deprioritized.
- **No generic "okay" copy** that earns a scroll; make it lovable or hateable.
- **No "congrats!" seeded replies** — every pre-briefed reply must add a distinct angle.
- **Don't lead with the spec, don't bury the POV, and don't post a tentpole from the brand handle.**

## Launch-Day Run-of-Show

Plan every beat weeks out — down to post order and who replies to what. A workable sequence:

1. **T-0:** Principal posts the hero post (hook + reframe + product + one visible asset/video).
2. **T+~2m:** Principal self-replies with the link and how to try it (link lives here, not in the root).
3. **T+~5m:** Co-founders / team / investors quote-tweet and reply, each with a distinct angle, to
   seed the reply chain.
4. **T+~1h:** Pre-warmed amplifiers (creators, "BREAKING…" accounts) post their own framed takes,
   staggered (not simultaneous) to extend the live window.
5. **T+~1d:** Principal replies to top replies and posts a "what people are saying" follow-up to feed
   the long tail.

Optional engagement mechanic (use sparingly — it reads growth-hacky if overused): "RT + comment 'X'
and we'll do Y for free," which manufactures the reply/RT signals the algorithm rewards.

## The Six-Phase X Launch Checklist

This is the agency's published, operational checklist, adapted here. It runs in order, from idea to
the week after launch. The sections above (two launch types, copy craft, run-of-show) are the
deep-dives; this is the end-to-end sequence. Keep the claims-hygiene rule in force throughout:
public copy states only what is true and attributable.

### Phase 1 — Foundation (before you build anything)

- **Write your bold claim.** One sentence: polarizing, defensible, novel. Not "AI-powered
  dashboard"; yes "See which deals close this quarter before they do." Sound like everyone else and
  the algorithm treats you like everyone else. Test: would someone screenshot it to argue with a
  friend?
- **Sell the outcome, not the feature.** Strip every feature to what the user walks away with.
  Features tell; outcomes sell. Write the outcome first, map features to it later.
- **Build your network before you need it.** Your launch is only as strong as the people you can
  activate on day one. Months ahead, log friendly, influential accounts (founders, operators, theme
  pages, niche creators). "Friendly" = they already like you, your product, or your space — warm
  beats big. Track engagement rate, niche fit, and whether their followers are your actual customers.
- **If you have no network, identify it now.** Map who you'd want, then start the relationship early:
  engage with substance, share their work, be useful before you ask. By launch day they should know
  your name.
- **Pre-write posts for your friendly accounts.** Draft custom posts in advance so day-one outreach
  is "here's a post ready to go," not "can you help?" A ready-made post is the easiest yes you'll get.
- **Identify your activatable communities.** Every category has groups easy to excite and groups easy
  to anger. List the communities around your product and how each reacts to bold messaging — you'll
  use this for both excitement and (defensible) rage-bait.
- **Map your product roadmap to your narrative.** The roadmap is content. Sequence features so each
  release gives a fresh bold claim. Build the product calendar and launch calendar together; always
  have the next story ready. (This is the [Marketing At The Table](#marketing-at-the-table) discipline.)

### Phase 2 — Outlier Research (the step everyone skips)

- **Spend 10–20 hours researching before writing a word.** You're not inventing content; you're
  finding what works and adapting it. The best launches copy proven formats.
- **Find 20+ outliers in your niche.** Search X for posts in your category with 500+ likes, 50+
  comments, 50+ reposts — roughly 10x normal engagement for the account size. These show what your
  audience actually responds to.
- **Document each outlier's anatomy:** hook format, structure (list/story/comparison/thread),
  emotional trigger (fear/curiosity/anger/aspiration), visual format (screenshot/video/text), and
  engagement pattern (genuine replies vs giveaway-driven).
- **Map the conversations already happening** — what your niche complains about, celebrates, argues
  over. The best hooks enter an existing conversation with a better answer; they don't start one.
- **Lock in 3–5 proven hook formats** that repeat across your outliers. Finish with saved examples,
  proven formats, a conversation map, an activatable-community list, and data-backed confidence.

### Phase 3 — Content Creation

- **Write every influencer post yourself** — word for word, with custom visuals per influencer.
  Influencers are good at being themselves and bad at selling your product; a brief reads as an ad.
- **Study each page for hours before writing** — their top posts from the last 90 days, the formats
  they lean on, their tone, and what their audience rewards in comments. Write something native to
  their feed but engineered to convert.
- **Match a proven format to each creator,** e.g. *Ways I Use It* ("5 ways I'm using [Product]"),
  *Comparison* ("[Product] vs [Competitor]"), or *Founder Story* (underdog + credentials).
- **Build the launch video to the rules:** bold claim in the first five seconds; show the product
  working in present tense; language below a fifth-grade reading level; audio and visual matched one
  to one; about the viewer's outcome, never your five-year journey. (See [`remotion-content-assets.md`](remotion-content-assets.md).)
- **Engineer one line of (defensible) rage-bait.** Find the most common criticism of your category
  and make your product the answer; bury one line a specific community can't ignore — subtle enough
  that most scroll past, pointed enough that ~10% quote-tweet it. **Keep it true and defensible: you
  want engagement, not a cancellation, and it must not cross the truthfulness/claims line.** This is a
  HIGH-sensitivity tactic — review it against [`ethics-guardrail.md`](ethics-guardrail.md) and the
  "public claims are liabilities" rule before it ships.

### Phase 4 — Amplification Roster (influencer selection)

- **Set roster and budget.** The agency's stated bands: roughly $500–$3,000 per influencer (~$1,000
  average), 30–100 influencers by campaign size, $50K+ amplification for a major launch. These are
  founder-gated spend decisions — route through [`paid-user-acquisition.md`](paid-user-acquisition.md).
- **Vet on engagement, not follower count.** Want audiences that comment with personal familiarity,
  niche business owners over generalists, followers who *are* your target customer, and creators who
  genuinely use tools like yours.
- **Cut the wrong fits:** accounts that post about everything, accounts where every post is an ad,
  high followers with low comment quality, anyone unwilling to work their comments.
- **Confirm each creator will reply to comments** on their sponsored post. Non-negotiable.

### Phase 5 — Launch-Day Timing Engine

One principle: make it feel organic. Layer amplification gradually, starting closest to your ICP and
expanding out. (This is the [Launch-Day Run-of-Show](#launch-day-run-of-show) above, in three gates.)

- **Gate 1 — Let it breathe (0–60 min).** Post goes live; do nothing externally. Let organic
  followers and the algorithm test it. Reply to every comment immediately. Watch likes-per-minute,
  reply quality, retweet pace. Strong velocity: proceed. Weak: fix before amplifying.
- **Gate 2 — First wave (hours 1–2).** If velocity holds, deploy the first 10–20 influencers,
  staggered across 30-minute windows (five, wait, five, wait). Start with the biggest ICP accounts.
  Each post retweets the main post, runs its own giveaway, and the creator works their comments.
- **Gate 3 — Full deployment + live adjustment (hours 2–3).** Everyone has posted by hour three. Add
  gas where momentum builds (theme pages, Discord communities); hold back channels where engagement
  slips; coordinate cross-engagement between influencers. Live adjustment separates good from great.
- **Reply to everything for 48 hours.** The single highest-leverage activity: author-reply chains are
  the strongest signal on the platform, and substantive replies (not "thanks") are what count.

### Phase 6 — Follow-Up Window (the launch never ends)

The algorithm gives you a momentum window after a viral post; content posted inside it gets boosted,
and most companies waste it. A workable cadence: **Day 2** meme or short AI-generated video riffing on
the launch; **Day 3** deep dive on one feature; **Day 4** founder story / behind-the-scenes; **Week 2**
results, testimonials, early traction. (This is the [feature-launch heartbeat](#feature-launch-cadence-the-heartbeat)
catching the tentpole's long tail.)

## How the X Algorithm Is Treated (Sourcing And Ranking)

This is the agency's working model of the platform — not official platform documentation — but it is
a useful planning lens. Two separate signals decide reach:

- **Sourcing — will your post be shown?** Retweets qualify a post for the For You feed. No retweets,
  no reach beyond your followers. This is why every giveaway requires a retweet.
- **Ranking — how high will it appear?** Reply chains where you respond back. The platform optimizes
  for time on site; conversation keeps people scrolling, and every author reply creates a new chain
  signaling the post is worth surfacing.

## Launch-Killing Mistakes

- **Creative:** a video about your journey instead of the viewer's outcome; jargon or above a
  fifth-grade level; past tense instead of present; no bold claim in the first five seconds; letting
  influencers write their own content; audio/visual mismatch.
- **Distribution:** not replying to comments; deploying all amplification at once; using theme pages
  too early before core engagement lands; no follow-up content; influencers in the wrong niche.
- **Positioning:** feature-focused over outcome-focused; not novel enough; too nuanced (save nuance
  for the replies); sitting on your ammunition (funding, revenue, or credential stats worth leading
  with — subject to the claims-hygiene rule).

## Final Principles

Novelty above all. No nuance. Show, don't tell. Reply to everything. Research first, then copy proven
formats. Intensity over vagueness. Outcomes over features. Speed beats perfect planning. Control
everything. The launch never ends.

## Measurement & Claims Hygiene

- Tie attention to product behavior via [`analytics-attribution.md`](analytics-attribution.md): post
  impressions → reply-link clicks (UTM'd) → install → activation event. Record the self-reported
  attribution source key per the `ANALYTICS.md` attribution contract.
- Watch a standing-audience metric weekly (followers gained, profile-served impressions, returning
  viewers), not just per-post views.
- Use exact, attributable numbers when you cite anyone (Koji ~4.71M, Moda funding ~4.50M, ChatGPT
  Paperwork ~2.66M). Do not launder rounded or unverifiable view/revenue claims into your own copy.
- The agency's **stated success bands** for a tentpole (targets to aim at, not promises): ~2–10M
  views across video + influencer posts + organic spread; 500–2,000+ comments (each replied to);
  1,000–5,000+ retweets. Treat these as planning targets, not guaranteed outcomes.

## Founder-Only Gates

Public posting and scheduling are founder-only. Pause for: the launch go-live decision, connecting
or posting from brand/founder social accounts, any paid amplification or creator spend (route through
[`paid-user-acquisition.md`](paid-user-acquisition.md)), and any public claim about views, revenue, or
"fastest-growing" that is not provably true.

## Traceability

The launch narrative is downstream of the product and brand decisions and upstream of the store
calendar and paid amplification:

- Feeling the launch must carry: [`emotional-design-system.md`](emotional-design-system.md) → `EMOTIONAL_DESIGN.md`.
- Magical V1 moment the launch sells: [`eleven-star-experience.md`](eleven-star-experience.md) → `11_STAR_EXPERIENCE.md`.
- Hero video and post assets: [`remotion-content-assets.md`](remotion-content-assets.md) → `CONTENT_ASSETS.md`.
- In-product loop the launch rides: [`viral-growth-loops.md`](viral-growth-loops.md) → `VIRAL_GROWTH.md`.
- Store launch calendar/listing alignment: [`aso-store-ops.md`](aso-store-ops.md) → `APP_STORE_LISTING.md`.
- Cross-surface launch decisions: `LAUNCH_TRACE.md`.
