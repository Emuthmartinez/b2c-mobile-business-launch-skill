# Paid Tool Routing And Free Fallbacks

Use this before using, skipping, or replacing any paid third-party tool or paid tier of a freemium tool in the launch workflow.

The rule is simple: tool access missing from the current runtime does not mean the founder lacks the tool, refuses to pay for it, or wants a weaker free fallback. Ask before spending tokens on a fallback path.

## Decision Protocol

1. Identify the preferred tool/tier and why it is useful for the lane. If a free tier exists, separate what it covers from the paid capability the lane actually needs.
2. Check for the MCP path first. Before concluding a paid tool is unavailable, use `ToolSearch` to search for `mcp__<TOOLNAME>__*` tools in the current runtime. For each primary tool, the exact prefix to search is:
   - AppKittie: `mcp__appkittie__`
   - XPOZ: `mcp__claude_ai_XPOZ__`
   - Higgsfield: `mcp__claude_ai_Higgsfield__`
   - Refero: `refero_search` (MCP or skill-provided)
   - MobAI: `mcp__mobai__`
   If the MCP tools are present and callable, use them. A tool that "did not show up as an available connector" is not the same as a tool absent from the runtime — verify via ToolSearch before concluding unavailable.
3. Check whether the user already supplied access, exports, screenshots, CSVs, PDFs, API keys, or prior results that satisfy the lane.
4. If the tool is genuinely unavailable, expired, unauthenticated, or blocked after the MCP check, stop before running the free fallback.
5. Ask the founder whether to use/provision the paid tool, provide access or exports, or continue with the fallback.
6. Continue only after the user confirms the paid path or the free fallback.
7. Record the decision in `TOOL_DECISIONS.md` or in the relevant ops doc when the launch is small.

Do not present a fallback artifact as equivalent to the paid-tool artifact. Label fallback outputs with confidence, limitations, and what the paid tool would have improved.

## Confirmation Prompt

Use the Founder Question Contract, not a free-text access blocker. Name the phase/outcome and define the tool's job. If this is only a provider-route decision, offer these three shapes through AskUserQuestion when available:

```text
Phase: <plain-language phase>. Outcome: <what this unlocks>.
I use <paid tool> for <plain-language job>, but usable access is not available right now.

1. Use or provision <paid tool> (Recommended when its evidence is launch-critical) - the founder handles only the minimum access/spend gate; the agent continues the intended route.
2. Use an export or approved <fallback> - the agent continues now and labels the lower confidence and limitations.
3. Defer this lane - the agent continues unrelated safe work; revisit before <specific milestone>.
```

If credits, a trial, subscription, or other spend is involved, separate that into a protected `spend` gate with an exact amount/ceiling and a defer choice; the fallback is a separate explicit route, never inferred authorization. If the founder says they have the tool, ask only for the minimum access/export needed. If the founder selects the free path, proceed and record the limitation.

## Tool Map

| Paid/account-gated tool or freemium paid tier | Preferred use | Free or lower-cost route and confirmation boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AppKittie | app-store economics, competitor intelligence, downloads/revenue estimates, keyword difficulty, reviews, ad/creator signals | public App Store/Google Play pages, store search, public reviews, app websites, manual competitor spreadsheet, Apple/Google console data if the app exists |
| XPOZ | Reddit, TikTok, X/Twitter, Instagram social-language and creator research | public web search, platform-native search in browser, Reddit search, YouTube comments, App Store/Play reviews, founder-provided screenshots/exports |
| Firecrawl | competitor site crawling, pricing/policy/funnel extraction, SEO/GEO page discovery | browser inspection, web search, `curl`, `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`, Playwright/browser snapshots, manual page notes |
| Higgsfield | generated visuals, app icons, mascots, mockups, animations, ad creative, demo clips; also `brand-kits fetch`, `reframe` (aspect-ratio variants), and `personal_clipper` (long recording → short clips) — all three are paid/credit-consuming MCP operations and require the same spend confirmation as any generate run | Remotion code-rendered videos/stills after license check, real app screenshots, founder-owned assets, hand-authored HTML/CSS/SVG/canvas, local screen recordings, free/public-domain assets with license notes |
| MobAI | Free tier: one device, limited daily AI usage, Testing Mode, and limited AI test generation/fixing. Plus/Pro: unlimited daily use; Pro adds unlimited devices, parallel suites, multi-device runs, and offline mode. | Use the MobAI free tier without a spend gate when it satisfies the lane. Ask before upgrade/trial/spend or before substituting XcodeBuildMCP because it narrows coverage to Apple; `xcodebuild`/`simctl` only if that route is approved and XcodeBuildMCP is unavailable. Use Android emulator/ADB or record a blocker for missing Android coverage. |
| Fastlane AI | post-launch organic content engine, Blitz generation, scheduling, analytics | manual content calendar, spreadsheet/JSON schedule, local prompts, platform-native drafts, no automated posting unless founder approves |
| Paid ASO/MMP/ad tools | keyword ranks, paid attribution, SKAdNetwork/ad-network reporting, competitor tracking | AppKittie if available, public store search, store-console analytics, manual keyword sheet, Apple Search Ads/Google Ads native reports when accounts exist |
| Sideshift or creator marketplace | creator sourcing, payouts, view tracking for UGC | manual TikTok sourcing, direct outreach, spreadsheet tracker, Stripe/Wise/Venmo payout records, creator-provided platform analytics screenshots |
| RevenueCat paid features | subscriptions, entitlements, experiments, web purchase links/funnels, webhooks | free RevenueCat tier when sufficient; local/mock purchase tests only for implementation, never as proof of live entitlement |
| Stripe paid/account features | web checkout, billing, tax, portal, webhooks | Stripe test mode when account exists; no real substitute for live payments and tax decisions |
| PostHog paid features | product analytics, experiments, session replay, surveys, data pipelines | PostHog free tier if sufficient; static event catalog and local logging only as pre-implementation planning |
| Resend paid/account features | verified sender domain, transactional/lifecycle email, broadcasts, webhooks, inbound | Resend free tier if sufficient; local email preview/logging for implementation only; Cloudflare Email Routing/Gmail for inbound support forwarding |

## Artifact Requirements

Create `TOOL_DECISIONS.md` when more than one paid or account-gated tool affects the launch.

Include:
- tool
- lane
- ideal paid workflow
- access status
- founder confirmation
- selected route: paid, export, free fallback, blocked, deferred
- fallback limitation
- license or rights status when a fallback uses Remotion, open-source media, public-domain assets, or founder-owned content
- downstream artifacts affected
- date checked

Small launches can add a "Tool decisions" section to `RESEARCH.md`, `ENGINEERING_PLAN.md`, `STORE_CONSOLE.md`, `SCREENSHOTS.md`, `FASTLANE_OPS.md`, or `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`.

## Founder Gates

Always ask before:
- signing up for a paid tool or starting a trial
- upgrading a plan
- using a paid API/credit budget
- creating paid cloud resources
- connecting social accounts
- changing billing, pricing, subscriptions, or live checkout
- publishing, submitting, scheduling, or posting
- entering credentials, API keys, or account sessions not already available

If the founder approves a fallback, do not keep re-asking for the same lane unless the fallback limitations change.

## Per-Tool Question Inputs

Use this table to fill the three-choice Confirmation Prompt; do not send it as an open-ended question. Every fallback choice states its evidence limit, and every defer choice states its revisit point.

| Tool | Plain-language job | Access/export choice | Explicit fallback choice | Evidence limit and revisit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AppKittie | keyword difficulty and competitor download/revenue estimates | provision access or provide CSV/screenshots | public store search plus a manual sheet | lower-confidence public estimates; revisit before final ASO positioning |
| XPOZ | language and creator research across social platforms | provision access or provide an export | platform-native browser search plus public web sources | smaller/non-equivalent sample; revisit before content strategy freezes |
| Higgsfield | generated visuals, icons, mascots, ads, and demo clips | provision access or provide existing assets | founder-owned assets or approved Remotion output after a license check | no equivalent generative exploration; revisit before final creative production |
| Refero | UX screen and flow references | provision Refero Pro or provide exported screens | bundled baseline pattern pack | no live Refero corpus; revisit before the design direction freezes |

Higgsfield credit use is a separate protected spend gate. Call `mcp__claude_ai_Higgsfield__balance`, show the current balance and estimated credits, then use AskUserQuestion: **full-quality exact batch** (recommended only when the evidence warrants the quoted spend), **cheap-first draft batch** with its lower credit estimate, or **defer generation** while non-spend preparation continues. No selection means no credits are used. `reframe` and `personal_clipper` are MCP-only and use the same spend gate; see `tool-recipes.md`.

## Common Failure Modes

- Treating a missing MCP tool as proof the founder does not own the service. **Always run ToolSearch for `mcp__<TOOLNAME>__*` before concluding a tool is unavailable.**
- Skipping the MCP-path detection step and jumping directly to a free fallback or curl-based scraping.
- XPOZ tools visible in `system-reminder` (e.g. `mcp__claude_ai_XPOZ__getRedditUser`) but agent claims "XPOZ not found" without calling ToolSearch to confirm.
- Higgsfield authenticated and MCP tools present, but agent does not invoke them because the work "only needed optimization" — use the tool or confirm with the founder that the lane is deferred.
- AppKittie `mcp__appkittie__batch_keyword_difficulty` available in the session but agent produces ASO keyword packets without calling it.
- Refero "not found" silently dropped — no TOOL_DECISIONS.md entry, no founder prompt, no fallback loaded.
- Running hours of manual free research when the founder would have provided an export or paid access.
- Replacing MobAI with XcodeBuildMCP without saying that Android coverage and some cross-device automation are no longer covered.
- Calling local mocks "validated" for RevenueCat, Stripe, PostHog, or Resend when provider dashboards were never checked.
- Generating visual assets with free local methods or Remotion after Higgsfield was intended, without asking whether the founder wants to use Higgsfield or approve the fallback.
- Treating Remotion as universally free for commercial work without checking the current Remotion license and recording eligibility or founder approval.
- Creating a store-console or ASO packet from public pages alone when App Store Connect or Google Play Console access was available but not requested.
- Presenting fallback outputs without a confidence label, limitation note, and TOOL_DECISIONS.md entry — every fallback decision must be recorded even when small.
