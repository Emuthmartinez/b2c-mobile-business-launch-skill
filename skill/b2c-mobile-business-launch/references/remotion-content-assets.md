# Remotion Content Assets

Use this when a launch needs reusable videos, stills, store-art compositions, app-preview clips, demo loops, social posts, ad variants, UGC overlays, or campaign assets and Higgsfield is unavailable, not approved, too expensive for the lane, or less appropriate than code-rendered product truth.

Remotion is not a drop-in replacement for Higgsfield. Higgsfield is the premium generative route for net-new imagery, mascots, presenter ads, image-to-video, photoreal scenes, Marketing Studio, and Virality Predictor. Remotion is the deterministic route for assets built from real app UI, founder-owned media, licensed/public-domain inputs, `DESIGN.md` tokens, copy variants, data, captions, and repeatable React compositions.

## Route Decision

Prefer Higgsfield when:
- the asset requires new AI-generated visuals, mascots, product/lifestyle scenes, presenter/UGC ad generation, image-to-video, or creative exploration
- the user wants Higgsfield, Marketing Studio, Soul ID, Seedance, Nano Banana, GPT Image, or Virality Predictor specifically
- the output should be a high-polish generated campaign visual rather than a reusable code-rendered template

Prefer Remotion when:
- the asset should be reproducible from product truth, screenshots, recordings, copy, tokens, or data
- many variants are needed: hooks, formats, dimensions, locales, CTAs, captions, App Store custom product pages, ads, or creator briefs
- real app UI must stay visible and distinguishable from generated supporting art
- the user does not want to pay for Higgsfield, Higgsfield access is blocked, or local code-rendering is a better fit

Do not create the asset yet when:
- Higgsfield was the intended paid route and the founder has not approved a fallback
- Remotion commercial-license eligibility is unclear for the business and the output is for commercial use
- the source app UI, screenshots, recordings, or asset rights are missing
- the asset would imply unsupported functionality, pricing, endorsements, outcomes, urgency, scarcity, or store claims
- the next step is public posting, scheduling, paid spend, or store upload without founder approval

## Founder And License Gates

Load `paid-tool-routing.md` before replacing Higgsfield with Remotion. Missing Higgsfield runtime access is not approval to use Remotion or another fallback.

Record the decision in `TOOL_DECISIONS.md`, `CONTENT_ASSETS.md`, or the relevant ops doc:
- intended route: Higgsfield, Remotion, founder-owned media, raw screenshots, or blocked
- why Remotion is appropriate for this asset
- founder approval for fallback if Higgsfield was intended
- Remotion license status or reason the render is evaluation-only
- source assets and rights status
- downstream surfaces affected: store, UGC, Fastlane, landing page, onboarding, app preview, ad, or creator brief

Remotion can be lower-cost, but it is not universally free for every commercial entity. Check the current Remotion license before commercial output. If the business appears to be outside free-license eligibility, stop for founder approval before buying a company license, using paid rendering infrastructure, or publishing the output.

## Source Inputs

Use truthful inputs before rendered embellishment:
- real app screenshots or recordings from MobAI, XcodeBuildMCP, simulator/device capture, Android emulator/ADB, or founder-owned captures
- `DESIGN.md` tokens, typography, voice, shape, spacing, and banned aesthetics
- `design.md`, `ONBOARDING.md`, `APP_STORE_LISTING.md`, `REVENUE_OPS.md`, `ANALYTICS.md`, and legal docs for claim and pricing truth
- founder-owned logos, icons, photos, audio, and product media
- licensed or public-domain assets with source/license notes
- copy datasets for hooks, CTAs, captions, subtitles, localizations, or store page variants

Do not present generated mock UI as production UI. If a screenshot, app preview, or demo clip uses mock data or unfinished screens, label that status and keep it out of final store upload until the real app state is captured.

## Project Shape

Do not add Remotion dependencies to this skill package. Create a launch-repo-local content workspace only when a project needs rendered content:

```text
content-assets/
  CONTENT_ASSETS.md
  content-assets.html
  manifest.json
  copy/
  inputs/
  remotion/
    README.md
    package.json
    remotion.config.ts
    src/
    public/
  out/
```

Use the Remotion starter only after the route is approved and license status is recorded:

```bash
mkdir -p content-assets
cd content-assets
npx create-video@latest --yes --blank --no-tailwind remotion
```

Use app-specific package scripts in `content-assets/remotion/package.json`, for example:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "studio": "remotion studio",
    "compositions": "remotion compositions",
    "render": "remotion render",
    "still": "remotion still"
  }
}
```

Keep raw captures under `content-assets/inputs/` or `screenshots/raw/`, generated outputs under `content-assets/out/`, and final store upload assets under the store screenshot path only after QA.

## Remotion Skill Routing

When writing Remotion code, use the `remotion-best-practices` skill if available. Refresh current Remotion docs through Context7 or official docs before setup, CLI flags, renderer API examples, or license-sensitive guidance.

Relevant Remotion skill rules:
- `compositions.md` for `Composition`, `Still`, default props, and folders
- `assets.md`, `images.md`, and `videos.md` for source media and `staticFile()`
- `parameters.md` for Zod schemas and input props
- `timing.md`, `sequencing.md`, `transitions.md`, and `text-animations.md` for frame-based animation
- `measuring-text.md` for fitting long text, localized strings, and store-safe overlays
- `subtitles.md` for captions
- `audio.md`, `sfx.md`, `ffmpeg.md`, and `silence-detection.md` for audio and post-processing
- `calculate-metadata.md` for dynamic duration, dimensions, and props

Remotion animation must be frame-driven with `useCurrentFrame()`, `interpolate()`, `spring()`, `Sequence`, or related Remotion APIs. Do not rely on CSS transitions or CSS animations for render-critical motion.

## Composition Standards

Create small, named compositions with explicit outputs:
- `VerticalHookDemo`: 1080x1920, 30fps, 6-20 seconds
- `SquareAdStill`: 1080x1080 still or short loop
- `StoreScreenshotFrame`: platform-specific dimensions with real app UI
- `AppPreviewClip`: App Store/Play preview dimensions and length constraints
- `CreatorBriefClip`: social-native product moment with captions and CTA

Each composition should have:
- stable composition ID
- explicit width, height, fps, and duration
- typed props and Zod schema when input varies
- default props that render without secrets or network access
- local assets in `public/` referenced with `staticFile()` or explicit remote URLs with license/source notes
- reduced-motion or still fallback where the asset appears in HTML proofs
- caption or silent-playback strategy for social clips

## Render Commands

Preview:

```bash
cd content-assets/remotion
npm run studio
```

List compositions:

```bash
cd content-assets/remotion
npx remotion compositions
```

Render a one-frame check:

```bash
cd content-assets/remotion
npx remotion still VerticalHookDemo --scale=0.25 --frame=30 --output ../out/vertical-hook-frame30.png
```

Render video:

```bash
cd content-assets/remotion
npx remotion render VerticalHookDemo --output ../out/vertical-hook-demo.mp4
```

Render still:

```bash
cd content-assets/remotion
npx remotion still SquareAdStill --output ../out/square-ad-still.png
```

If renders use audio, captions, trimming, or format conversion, record FFmpeg commands and outputs in `CONTENT_ASSETS.md`.

## Asset QA

Before marking a content asset done:
- real app UI is visible where the asset claims to show the app
- source screenshots/recordings, design tokens, copy, and legal/pricing claims are traceable
- Remotion license status and Higgsfield fallback approval are recorded
- public claims match `APP_STORE_LISTING.md`, `REVENUE_OPS.md`, `PRIVACY.md`, `TERMS.md`, and onboarding/paywall copy
- no generated or mock UI is presented as real production functionality
- captions, silent playback, text fit, safe areas, and mobile readability are checked
- output dimensions, duration, codec/container, and target surface are recorded
- render command and output path are recorded
- HTML proof embeds or links representative output
- store uploads, public posting, scheduling, and paid campaigns remain founder-approved

For store screenshots and previews, app UI must be truthful and Apple/Google policy-aligned. Remotion can frame, caption, compose, resize, or animate real captures, but it cannot make unsupported product claims true.

## Artifacts

Create `CONTENT_ASSETS.md` when Remotion, Higgsfield, local recordings, or generated/edited campaign assets are in scope.

Include:
- route matrix: Higgsfield, Remotion, raw screenshots, founder-owned media, blocked, or deferred
- license and fallback approvals
- source input inventory and rights notes
- composition manifest
- target surfaces and dimensions
- render commands and proof paths
- QA checklist and claim review
- output registry
- blocked assets and founder-only gates

Create `content-assets/manifest.json` for machine-readable assets. Each asset should include:
- `asset_id`
- `surface`
- `route`
- `status`
- `composition_id`
- `dimensions`
- `duration_seconds` when video
- `inputs`
- `outputs`
- `truth_constraints`
- `approvals`
- `render_proof`
- `license_status`

Create or update `content-assets.html` as the founder-facing proof board. It should show route decisions, asset thumbnails/placeholders, target surfaces, source inputs, output paths, QA status, and blocked approvals.

Update `PROJECT_STATE.yaml`:
- `lanes.content_assets.status`
- `lanes.content_assets.evidence`
- `tools.remotion.route`
- `tools.remotion.docs_checked_at`
- `tools.remotion.license_status`
- `tools.remotion.preflight`
- `tools.remotion.validation`
- `tools.remotion.fallback`

## Common Failure Modes

- Treating Higgsfield unavailability as automatic permission to use Remotion.
- Calling Remotion a free fallback without checking license eligibility.
- Rendering polished mock UI and letting it drift into store screenshots or product claims.
- Creating videos without `DESIGN.md`, source screenshots, captions, text-fit checks, or claim review.
- Making one-off assets with no manifest, render command, or rerender path.
- Forgetting that public posting, scheduling, store uploads, paid campaigns, and creator spend require founder approval.
- Bundling a heavy Remotion project inside this skill instead of creating it in the launch repo that owns the media.
