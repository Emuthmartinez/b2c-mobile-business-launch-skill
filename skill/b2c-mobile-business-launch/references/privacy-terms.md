# Privacy And Terms Pages

Use this before drafting or publishing privacy policy, terms of service, EULA, subscription terms, account deletion, privacy choices, App Store privacy answers, or Google Play Data safety answers.

This is a workflow, not legal advice. Agents may research, draft, implement pages, and prepare review packets. Founder/legal approval is required before publishing final legal terms or making material privacy promises.

When store submission is in scope, also load `store-console-workflow.md`. For Apple App Store listings, also load `app-store-listing-prep.md` and use `templates/app-store-listing/app-privacy-questionnaire.html` or an equivalent interactive worksheet when the founder needs to review privacy answers. Privacy/terms work must produce the public pages and the console answers: Apple App Privacy data types, Google Play Data safety answers, account deletion URLs, reviewer access notes, and source evidence.

## 1. Refresh Official Sources

Always verify current requirements before drafting. Prefer official platform, regulator, and vendor docs.

Baseline sources to check:
- Apple App Privacy Details and App Store Connect EULA/custom license guidance for iOS.
- Google Play User Data and Data safety requirements for Android.
- Apple App Review Guideline 3.1.1, Google Play Payments policy, RevenueCat, Stripe, and tax/customer-portal docs when subscriptions, paid access, web checkout, or direct funnels exist.
- FTC privacy/security guidance for mobile apps, health/wellness data, children, subscriptions, advertising, and security.
- California CCPA/CPRA and CalOPPA guidance if the app serves U.S. consumers or California users.
- EU/EEA GDPR transparency guidance if the app is offered to EU/EEA users.
- Vendor docs for analytics, attribution, ads, AI providers, payment/subscription tooling, backend, email, crash reporting, and push notifications. For PostHog, refresh product analytics, web analytics, mobile SDK, anonymous vs identified events, persons/properties, feature flags/experiments, session replay privacy, surveys, and data pipeline docs when those features are used.

Record checked sources, dates, and URLs in `LEGAL_REVIEW.md`. Mirror store-specific sources and final console answers in `STORE_CONSOLE.md` when App Store Connect or Google Play Console submission is in scope.

## 2. Build The Data Inventory First

Do not draft from a template first. Inventory actual data flows from code and launch docs:

- Landing: email, referral code, IP/rate-limit signals, cookies/localStorage, UTM/referrer, analytics, A/B tests.
- App account: email, auth ID, profile, subscription entitlement, support IDs.
- User content: goals, notes, photos, journal entries, plans, messages, crew/social content.
- Device/platform data: push token, device ID, advertising ID, precise/coarse location, contacts, calendar, camera, microphone, HealthKit/Health Connect, files/photos.
- Backend: database tables, storage buckets, logs, edge functions, RPCs, retention jobs.
- Analytics and ads: events, PostHog person profiles, UTM/referrer/click IDs, self-reported attribution, session replay, heatmaps, surveys, feature flags, experiments, data pipelines/destinations, pixels, ad networks.
- Payments/subscriptions: RevenueCat/Stripe/Apple/Google identifiers, purchase history, refund status.
- AI: prompts, outputs, model provider, model-training settings, human review, logging/retention.
- Support/comms: email provider, CRM, feedback forms, transactional email, push providers.
- Security: audit logs, fraud prevention, abuse reports, rate limits.

For each data type, record:
- source surface
- purpose
- whether required or optional
- whether linked to identity
- whether shared with a vendor
- whether sold/shared for cross-context advertising
- retention period
- deletion path
- app-store disclosure mapping

## 3. Privacy Policy Drafting Rules

The policy must reflect actual practices, not aspirations. Include:

- effective date and last updated date
- legal/business entity, app/site names covered, and privacy contact
- what data is collected, grouped by user-understandable categories
- why each category is used
- vendors/processors and categories of recipients
- tracking, ads, analytics, attribution, and cross-app/site sharing
- AI processing and whether user content is used for model training
- subscriptions/payments and what Apple/Google/Stripe/RevenueCat process
- web checkout, web funnels, redemption links, billing portal/customer portal, tax collection, invoices/receipts, refunds, and subscription lifecycle emails when used
- Resend or other email-provider behavior: transactional email, lifecycle automations, broadcasts/newsletters, contacts/topics/segments, unsubscribe/preference handling, open/click tracking if enabled, inbound email and attachments if used, and retention/deletion behavior
- device permissions and just-in-time notices for sensitive/unexpected data
- retention and deletion
- account deletion and data request URL if accounts exist
- children/age posture
- health, biometrics, precise location, contacts, calendar, or other sensitive data sections when relevant
- user rights by jurisdiction where applicable
- security summary in plain language
- international transfers where applicable
- policy changes and contact

Platform must-haves:
- Apple requires a publicly accessible privacy policy URL and accurate App Privacy responses, including third-party partner practices.
- Google Play requires a privacy policy link in Play Console and in-app link/text; the policy must include developer/contact info, data accessed/collected/used/shared, parties shared with, secure handling, retention/deletion, and be active, public, non-geofenced, non-editable, and not a PDF.
- If accounts can be created, publish a web account-deletion path and explain retained data.
- Privacy, support, and data-deletion contact addresses must be route-tested before publishing. If using Cloudflare Email Routing, verify destination addresses, enable/connect Email Routing, configure required DNS records, and test from an external sender. Do not assume inbound forwarding also supports outbound send-as.

## 4. Terms/EULA Drafting Rules

Terms should match the product and payment behavior. Include:

- effective date, contracting entity, and contact
- who may use the service and age restrictions
- account responsibilities and acceptable use
- license to use the app/service
- user content ownership, permissions, and removal/moderation if user content exists
- AI-generated content/coaching disclaimers if AI is used
- professional-advice disclaimers for health, wellness, financial, legal, education, or productivity coaching claims where relevant
- subscription, trial, renewal, cancellation, refund, and price-change terms
- platform billing terms: Apple/Google manage in-app purchases when used
- intellectual property and feedback
- third-party services
- privacy-policy cross-reference
- warranty disclaimer, limitation of liability, indemnity, termination, changes, governing law, dispute resolution, and severability

Apple-specific:
- Decide whether Apple's standard EULA is enough or a custom EULA/terms is needed.
- If using a custom EULA in App Store Connect, keep it plain text and ensure it meets Apple's minimum terms.

Subscription-specific:
- Paywall, App Store/Play listing, terms, and in-app subscription management copy must agree on price, trial length, renewal cadence, cancellation, and what happens after cancellation.
- Do not bury trial-to-paid conversion or cancellation mechanics only in terms.
- Web checkout/funnel pages must disclose the billing provider, renewal price, cancellation path, refund/support contact, and whether access is redeemed in app through RevenueCat or another entitlement system.

## 5. Public Pages And App Links

For launch funnels and apps, create URLs that are stable before store submission:

- `/privacy` - privacy policy
- `/terms` - terms of service or terms of use
- `/privacy/choices` or `/data` - rights, privacy choices, and account/data deletion when applicable
- `/delete-account` - direct account deletion instructions or request form when app accounts exist

Verification:
- pages return HTTP 200 on canonical domain
- linked in footer, app settings, onboarding/paywall where relevant, App Store Connect, Play Console
- contact emails listed on the pages receive mail and have an owner — before writing any `@yourdomain.com` address into copy, run `dig MX yourdomain.com +short` to confirm MX records exist; if none, use a tested fallback and open a `legal-contact-email-mx-unverified` failure card (see `references/geo-seo.md` section 4a)
- readable on mobile
- not blocked by robots/auth/geofencing
- not a PDF for Google Play privacy policy
- app-store labels/data safety answers match the pages

## 6. Review Packet

Before publishing final legal pages, produce `LEGAL_REVIEW.md` with:

- official sources checked
- data inventory table
- vendors and SDKs
- draft page paths
- app-store disclosure mapping
- App Store Connect App Privacy and Google Play Data safety answer mapping, with click paths and field values when submission is in scope
- interactive App Privacy questionnaire path and unanswered/manual-review items when Apple listing prep is in scope
- subscription and refund terms
- account deletion flow
- known uncertainty and legal questions
- approval checkbox for founder/counsel

Never mark legal pages final without approval. If the founder wants a fast pre-launch page, label it as a draft pending counsel review in internal docs, but do not put that disclaimer on the public policy unless counsel approves.
