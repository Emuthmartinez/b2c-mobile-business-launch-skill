# Emotional Experience Design

Use this reference before any product, onboarding, paywall, or core-loop work where the goal is to make interactions feel charged with meaning — not merely functional. Apps that anticipate, solve, and reward action retain users because they create emotional memory, not just utility.

Load `eleven-star-experience.md` first. The star ladder defines the target emotional state; this reference defines the mechanics and verification to reach it. Load `analytics-attribution.md` before implementation: every emotional moment named here must emit a named PostHog event or it is unmeasurable.

## The Four Required Experience Cards

Every B2C mobile app built with this skill must implement all four Experience Cards. They are not optional polish — they are the mechanics that separate a 6-star ("better than expected") product from a 5-star commodity.

For each card: implement the pattern, emit the named PostHog event, verify the bright line, and record evidence in `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`.

---

### Commitment Card

**Psychological basis:** Commitment and consistency principle (Cialdini, _Influence_, 1984): people align future behavior with prior commitments, especially when the commitment was active, public, or effortful. Goal-setting theory (Locke & Latham, 1990): specific, challenging goals produce higher performance than vague intentions. Implementation intentions (Gollwitzer, 1999): if-then plans convert stated goals into automatic action.

**What it is.** A deliberate, low-stakes commitment the user makes early — a goal statement, a preference selection, a personal target, a schedule — that the product then reflects back throughout the experience. The act of choosing creates ownership. Future prompts reference it, making the product feel continuous and personal.

**When to trigger.** During onboarding, at the first personalization question, or at the first time the user declares a goal or preference. The product must echo the commitment in downstream screens (plan summary, push copy, coach responses, progress headers, milestone labels).

**Bright line.**
- Bright side: the commitment reflects the user's real intent. The product uses it to serve them better.
- Dark side: using a low-stakes commitment to lock users into a subscription they did not explicitly understand, or using it to manufacture false social proof ("10,000 people with your goal started today"). Both are veto-level dark patterns.

**Guardrail (deterministic).** The commitment must be editable at any time from a settings or profile screen. If the user cannot update or delete their stated goal/commitment without a support ticket, this card is non-compliant.

**PostHog events.** `commitment_made` with `commitment_type`, `commitment_value`, `flow_id`, `step_id`; `commitment_echoed` with `surface`, `commitment_type`, `commitment_value`.

**11-star mapping.** Elevates from 5-star (neutral setup form) to 6-star (product remembers me) or 7-star (product feels made for me). The commitment is evidence for the 7-star label in `11_STAR_EXPERIENCE.md`.

---

### Variable Reward Card

**Psychological basis.** Operant conditioning / variable-ratio reinforcement schedule (B.F. Skinner, _The Behavior of Organisms_, 1938): intermittent, unpredictable rewards produce the highest response rates and greatest resistance to extinction. Dopamine reward-prediction-error signal: dopamine fires on the anticipation of reward, not on receipt — the peak is the moment before the result is revealed (Wolfram Schultz, _Science_, 1997). Wanting vs liking dissociation: the dopamine system drives wanting/seeking but is dissociated from liking/pleasure (Kent Berridge, _Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews_, 1996). Hook Model: Variable Reward (rewards of tribe, hunt, and self) is step 3 in the Trigger→Action→Variable Reward→Investment loop (Nir Eyal, _Hooked_, 2014).

**What it is.** A moment where the user takes an action, experiences a beat of anticipation, and receives a result that varies across a meaningful positive range — not a guaranteed outcome. The anticipation window is the emotional lever. The variation must be real, not cosmetic: the content, match quality, insight, recommendation, or experience must genuinely differ.

**When to trigger.** On the first result reveal, plan generation, match/recommendation surface, streak milestone check, or any core-loop completion where the outcome is legitimately variable. Do not apply this pattern to transactional, predictable confirmations (e.g. "payment received").

**Bright line.**
- Bright side: the variation reflects real personalization, discovery, or learning — the user genuinely does not know which insight or result they will see, and every possible result serves their goal.
- Dark side: simulated variation (randomized label on identical outcomes), artificial delay on a pre-computed result with no real variance, or loot-box mechanics where paid money buys uncertain outcomes. Gambling-adjacent mechanics in apps rated 4+ are a platform policy violation and a skill-level compliance veto.

**Guardrail (deterministic).** The result must be genuinely variable in content, not only in cosmetic framing. If the same user action always produces an identical backend result, the animation is deceptive. Implementation must pass a test where two consecutive completions of the same action produce observably different content outputs at least 30% of the time, OR the product can demonstrate that variation is real but unlikely to occur on consecutive attempts due to personalization convergence. Record the proof method in `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`.

**PostHog events.** `variable_reward_anticipation_started` with `surface`, `reward_type`, `flow_id`; `variable_reward_revealed` with `surface`, `reward_type`, `reward_variant`, `anticipation_duration_ms`.

**11-star mapping.** Elevates from 5-star (expected result shown immediately) to 6-star (result delivery feels meaningful) or 7-star (result feels personally discovered). Maps directly to the "dopamine pulse" moment in the experience ladder.

---

### Perceived Effort Delay Card

**Psychological basis.** Labor illusion / operational transparency: customers who can see effort being done on their behalf are more satisfied with the outcome and willing to pay more, even when the actual processing time is identical (Ryan Buell & Michael Norton, _Management Science_, 2011). IKEA effect: users value outcomes more when they participated in producing them (Norton, Mochon & Ariely, _Journal of Consumer Psychology_, 2012). Peak-end rule: the emotional peak of an experience and its end dominate the overall memory of it (Kahneman & Fredrickson, _Psychological Science_, 1993).

**What it is.** A deliberate, honest display of processing, assembly, or effort that makes the user perceive the output as crafted for them — not instantly auto-generated. The product shows its work: scanning steps, building a plan, analyzing data, assembling pieces. The actual time is tuned to feel earned, not slow. The delay can be real (slow computation) or designed (real processing re-paced with visible stepwise progress). It is honest if the displayed steps correspond to real operations; it is deceptive if the steps are cosmetic progress bars over pre-computed results.

**When to trigger.** Plan generation, personalized report creation, first AI analysis, match scoring, or any high-stakes first result where the user has invested several onboarding steps. Do not apply to routine CRUD operations or paywall interactions.

**Bright line.**
- Bright side: the displayed steps correspond to real computational steps (even if re-paced), and the final output is genuinely assembled from the user's inputs. The delay creates appreciation.
- Dark side: a purely cosmetic spinner on a pre-rendered result with zero relationship between the displayed steps and the actual computation. If the product team can ship a result in 50ms but adds a 4s spinner with fake steps, that is a deceptive dark pattern even if the result is accurate.

**Guardrail (deterministic).** At least 50% of the displayed processing steps must correspond to a real computational operation (data fetch, model inference, sorting, filtering, formatting, or rendering). The product spec must document the step-to-operation map in `TECH_SPEC.md`. If this cannot be verified, use a simpler loading state instead.

**PostHog events.** `perceived_effort_started` with `surface`, `effort_type`, `step_count`; `perceived_effort_completed` with `surface`, `effort_type`, `step_count`, `total_duration_ms`, `real_step_ratio`.

**11-star mapping.** Elevates from 5-star (instant generic result) to 6-star (result feels assembled for me) or 7-star (I believe the product worked hard on my behalf). Maps to the "higher perceived value" behavior on the star ladder.

---

### Intent Mirroring Card

**Psychological basis.** Reflective design: the highest tier of emotional design, where a product makes the user reflect on themselves, their values, or their goals (Don Norman, _Emotional Design_, 2004). Affective computing: systems that recognize, interpret, and respond to human emotional state create significantly stronger engagement and trust (Rosalind Picard, _Affective Computing_, 1997). Implementation intentions amplified by mirroring: when an if-then plan is read back to the user in their own language, follow-through rates increase (Gollwitzer, 1999).

**What it is.** A deliberate pause in the interaction where the product mirrors the user's stated intent back to them — in their own words, at a quiet moment, before the next action. Not a confirmation message. Not a summary screen. A pause with meaning: "You said you want to feel more confident before your presentation. Let's build that." The intent mirror turns a transactional interaction (I answered a question) into a meaningful moment (this product understands why I am here).

**When to trigger.** After the commitment is captured, before the paywall, after the first value reveal, or at the beginning of a session when the user returns. Limit to 1-2 triggers per session — overuse converts meaning into noise.

**Bright line.**
- Bright side: the mirror reflects the user's actual stated words or selections, back to them, in a way that serves their goal. It creates recognition and trust.
- Dark side: manufactured emotional urgency ("You said you were failing — don't give up now"), manipulative guilt ("Remember why you started?"), or mirror language that escalates anxiety to drive a purchase. These are dark patterns and a compliance veto.

**Guardrail (deterministic).** The mirrored content must use only fields the user explicitly provided (answer selections, free text, goal statements, commitment values). It must never infer or manufacture emotional states the user did not express. The implementation must be reviewed against `BRAND.md §Voice` to ensure the tone is warm, not coercive. The mirror must not be followed by a paywall or hard CTA in the same screen. Record the trigger source and content source in `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`.

**PostHog events.** `intent_mirror_shown` with `surface`, `mirror_type`, `source_field`, `trigger_context`; `intent_mirror_continued` with `surface`, `next_action`.

**11-star mapping.** This is the 7-star mechanic: "made for me." The mirror is the moment the user believes the product knows them, not just their data. It is the experience that produces word-of-mouth.

## Six-Lens Design Review Framework

Run this review per feature or per journey before build handoff. Each lens has an exact question, evidence to capture on a real device, and a sub-score (0–2). Total score: 0–12. A feature at 0–5 needs redesign. 6–8 needs refinement. 9–12 is ready for build handoff.

Use this framework as the operative tool for any UX or onboarding audit subagent. Each finding must reference its lens, its score change, and its star-ladder level per the UX And Onboarding Audit Output Contract in `eleven-star-experience.md`.

---

### Lens 1: Human Goal / Job-To-Be-Done

**Exact question.** What is the user actually trying to accomplish at this step — not what the product makes them do, but what they hired the product to do?

**Evidence to capture.** On a real device: narrate the step aloud from the user's perspective. If the narration sounds like "I am completing the app's form" rather than "I am one step closer to my goal," the job is product-centric, not user-centric.

**Sub-score.**
- 0: the step serves the product's data collection or flow logic, not the user's goal.
- 1: the step serves the user's goal but the connection is implicit — the user has to trust it.
- 2: the step clearly, explicitly advances the user's named goal. The user can see why this step exists.

**Tool.** Use Alan Cooper's goal-directed design framing: design from the user's goal back to the interaction, not forward from the data model.

---

### Lens 2: Emotional Goal

**Exact question.** What emotional state is the user seeking at this moment — and does this screen move them toward it?

**Target state taxonomy.** Confidence, belonging, relief, progress, status, safety, delight, mastery. Name the target before the screen is designed.

**Evidence to capture.** On a real device: screenshot the screen. Write the target state in one word. Rate how strongly the screen delivers that state (0 = does not deliver, 1 = partially delivers, 2 = clearly delivers). Look at copy tone, visual weight, color energy, and motion direction.

**Sub-score.**
- 0: the screen has no emotional target or moves the user toward the wrong emotion (anxiety on a relief surface, confusion on a mastery surface).
- 1: the emotional target is implicit or partially served.
- 2: the screen clearly and intentionally delivers the target emotional state.

**Tool.** Norman's emotional design tiers (visceral/behavioral/reflective). The visceral tier (appearance) sets the first emotional tone; the behavioral tier (usability) sustains it; the reflective tier (meaning) locks it into memory.

---

### Lens 3: Emotional Journey

**Exact question.** Map the sequence: starting emotion → trigger → interaction → friction → resolution → end emotion. Where are the peaks and valleys?

**Evidence to capture.** On a real device, run the feature end-to-end. At each screen transition, write the user's likely emotional state in one word. Mark the highest point (emotional peak) and the lowest point (friction valley). The journey should reach an emotional high before or at the paywall, not after.

**Emotional Journey format (required artifact input for the EMOTIONAL CURVE):**

```
step_id | screen_label | starting_emotion | trigger | interaction | friction | resolution | end_emotion | peak_valley
```

Highs are marked `peak`. Lows are marked `valley`. The Emotional Curve is plotted from this data.

**Sub-score.**
- 0: the journey descends — the user ends a worse emotional state than they started.
- 1: the journey is flat — no peaks and no significant valleys.
- 2: the journey rises — there is at least one genuine emotional peak before the paywall or primary CTA.

**Tool.** Peak-end rule (Kahneman & Fredrickson): design for the emotional peak and the end state. These dominate the user's memory of the experience, not the average.

---

### Lens 4: Behavioral Analysis

**Exact question.** For this step: what is the user's motivation level, ability level, and what friction exists? Does the product call for action at the right moment?

**Framework.** Fogg Behavior Model (BJ Fogg, _Tiny Habits_, 2019): B = MAP. Behavior occurs when Motivation, Ability, and a Prompt align. High motivation tolerates low ability (complex tasks feel worth it). Low motivation requires high ability (frictionless tasks still happen). A prompt fires at the wrong motivation-ability moment produces abandonment.

**Evidence to capture.** On a real device: rate motivation at this step (1–5), rate ability/ease at this step (1–5), and rate friction (form complexity, copy density, required decisions, cognitive load, trust signals absent). Map the result: is the prompt firing at a high-motivation/high-ability moment?

Decision fatigue and cognitive load check: count the number of decisions on the screen. More than 2 distinct decisions on one screen is a cognitive load flag.

Habit formation check: does this action fit into a daily routine the user already has, or does it require creating a new behavior pattern entirely?

**Sub-score.**
- 0: low motivation + low ability + high friction. The prompt fires at the worst possible moment.
- 1: motivation and ability are mismatched (high motivation, low ability with complex friction; or low motivation with low-friction but no reason to act now).
- 2: high motivation + high ability + low friction. The prompt fires at the right moment and the action feels easy.

---

### Lens 5: Experience Quality

**Exact question.** What tier of experience quality does this screen deliver — visceral, behavioral, or reflective — and is it consistent with the product's 7-star aspiration?

**Framework.** Norman's three tiers:
- Visceral: the appearance, motion, and sensory first impression. Does it feel premium in the first 500ms?
- Behavioral: the interaction — does it work smoothly, with feedback on every state, and without errors?
- Reflective: the meaning — does the screen make the user feel understood, special, or proud of their choice?

**Evidence to capture.** On a real device: time the first impression (under 500ms, does it feel right?). Tap every interactive element and check for loading, error, and empty states. Ask: "Would this user feel proud to show this screen to a friend?"

**Sub-score.**
- 0: visceral quality is poor (outdated styling, generic, mismatched tokens) and/or interaction has broken/missing states.
- 1: visceral and behavioral quality is acceptable, but reflective quality is absent — nothing makes the user feel understood.
- 2: all three tiers are present. The screen looks right, works smoothly, and means something to the user.

---

### Lens 6: Service Design

**Exact question.** How does this touchpoint connect to the rest of the user's journey — across platform, session, and failure state?

**Evidence to capture.** On a real device: test the failure path (network down, unexpected input, empty state, session restart). Does the product remember the user's progress? Does the error message tell the user what to do next? Is the cross-platform experience (notification, email, web, widget) consistent with the app's voice?

**Sub-score.**
- 0: failure states are missing or hostile. The product drops the user with no recovery path.
- 1: failure states exist but are generic. Cross-platform touchpoints (email, push) feel disconnected from the in-app voice.
- 2: failure states are graceful and on-brand. The product remembers the user's state across sessions. Cross-platform touchpoints feel like the same product.

---

## Emotional Curve Artifact

The Emotional Curve is a required artifact for any feature or journey reviewed with this framework. It is produced from the Lens 3 journey map and must be rendered in `design.html` or the journey's dedicated design surface.

**Format.** A line chart where:
- X axis: ordered journey steps (screen labels or step IDs).
- Y axis: emotional valence (−5 to +5, where −5 is strong negative emotion, 0 is neutral, +5 is strong positive emotion).
- Each step plotted as a point connected by a line.
- Peaks labeled with the target emotional state.
- Valleys labeled with the friction source.
- A horizontal reference line at y=0.
- A vertical marker at the paywall / primary CTA step.

**Acceptance rule.** The curve must peak at or before the paywall marker. A curve that first crosses above +2 after the paywall is a conversion design failure: the user is asked to buy before they feel the value.

**How to produce.** Run Lens 3 on a real device, fill in the emotional journey table, assign numeric valence scores to each step, and plot the curve. Embed it in `design.html` using the project's design tokens (CSS variables from `DESIGN.md`). Do not leave it as a text table — it must be a visible rendered chart inspectable by the founder.

**Reduced-motion fallback.** If the rendered Emotional Curve uses animation to draw the line, implement `prefers-reduced-motion` / OS reduce-motion check. Static chart is the fallback.

---

## Analytics Events For Emotional Moments

Add these to `ANALYTICS.md` before implementation. Do not invent event names outside this catalog without first adding the candidate to `ANALYTICS.md`.

```
commitment_made            surface, commitment_type, commitment_value, flow_id, step_id
commitment_echoed          surface, commitment_type, commitment_value
variable_reward_anticipation_started  surface, reward_type, flow_id
variable_reward_revealed   surface, reward_type, reward_variant, anticipation_duration_ms
perceived_effort_started   surface, effort_type, step_count
perceived_effort_completed surface, effort_type, step_count, total_duration_ms, real_step_ratio
intent_mirror_shown        surface, mirror_type, source_field, trigger_context
intent_mirror_continued    surface, next_action
peak_moment_reached     surface, step_id, emotional_target, score_contribution
```

Cross-reference the existing catalog in `analytics-attribution.md` before adding. `peak_moment_reached` should fire when a screen reaches a +3 or above valence point in the Emotional Curve; use the step_id and emotional_target from the Lens 3 journey map.

---

## Design And Motion Rules

Every emotional moment must be expressed in motion. Motion is a delight lever per `design-visual-system.md` and `design-room.md`.

**Web surfaces.** Use tokenized `motion/*` values from `state/theme.tokens.json` promoted to CSS `--motion-*` variables. Drive animations with `motion/react` (framer-motion successor).

**Mobile binary.** Use native animation from `DesignTokens.Motion` on SwiftUI/Flutter/React Native Reanimated. Do not hardcode durations or easing values — reference the token.

**Reduced-motion requirement.** Every delight moment that uses animation must implement a `prefers-reduced-motion` / OS reduce-motion check. The fallback must be a functional, non-animated version of the same interaction. Record fallback implementation for each card in `TECH_SPEC.md`.

**Timing guidance for each card:**
- Commitment Card echo: use a soft fade or gentle highlight (duration: `motion.brief`, ~150ms) when the commitment value is reflected back.
- Variable Reward anticipation: use a pulsing or breathing animation during the anticipation window (duration: 1.5–3s, loop `motion.moderate` easing); reveal uses a spring with `motion.expressive` easing.
- Perceived Effort steps: step transitions use `motion.brief` between steps; the final reveal uses `motion.expressive` spring.
- Intent Mirror: slow fade-in with a pause (duration: `motion.deliberate`, ~600ms) to signal this is a meaningful moment, not a transition.

---

## Bright Line: Serve vs Exploit

Every Experience Card has a bright line. This section collects the governing rule for the entire reference.

**Serve the user's real goal.** The test: does this mechanic make the user more likely to achieve what they said they wanted to achieve when they opened the app? If yes, it is on the bright side.

**Exploit against the user's interest.** The test: does this mechanic generate revenue, engagement, or retention by working against the user's stated goal, exploiting uncertainty, manufacturing urgency, or making it harder to leave? If yes, it is a dark pattern. Dark patterns are a compliance veto that blocks ship/merge decisions — same governance level as a `security-release-lane-missing` failure card.

**Regulatory context.** As of 2024–2026, the EU Digital Services Act, FTC enforcement, and Apple/Google platform policy have all moved against deceptive UX patterns. The skill's dark-pattern veto is stricter than any single regulation.

**Quick checklist.** Before shipping a feature that uses any card mechanic, answer:
- [ ] The user can always choose to leave, cancel, or skip without a penalty or a guilt-laden interstitial.
- [ ] The commitment is editable by the user at any time.
- [ ] The variable reward variation is real, not cosmetic.
- [ ] The perceived effort steps correspond to real operations (≥50% mapping documented in `TECH_SPEC.md`).
- [ ] The intent mirror uses only content the user explicitly provided.
- [ ] None of the four cards' triggers are coupled to a paywall CTA on the same screen.

If any answer is no, fix the mechanic or remove it. Do not ship.

## Failure Cards

These failure cards integrate with `failure-cards.md`. Open a card when the condition is detected; close it only when the evidence and fix requirements are met.
