# App Store Connect CLI Routing

Use this before automating App Store Connect work with the Rork `asc` CLI or the Rork App Store Connect CLI skills.

The goal is to reduce App Store Connect clicking while preserving founder control over credentials, pricing, products, privacy answers, screenshots, and final submission.

Default stance: if the work is App Store Connect related, try the ASC CLI or ASC CLI skill pack route first. Do not tell the founder an agent cannot create the app, inspect ASC state, upload screenshots, manage metadata, run TestFlight, or reconcile products until `asc auth status`, the local `asc --help`/skill-pack help, and the current docs prove the route is unavailable. Missing credentials, 2FA, unsigned agreements, unapproved sticky fields, or missing founder approval are blockers, not proof the CLI cannot do the work.

## Current Sources To Refresh

Refresh these before running or writing commands:
- App Store Connect CLI skills: `https://github.com/rorkai/app-store-connect-cli-skills`
- App Store Connect CLI: `https://github.com/rorkai/App-Store-Connect-CLI`
- Official Apple App Store Connect docs referenced in `store-console-workflow.md`
- Official Apple signing/account docs referenced in `apple-signing-release.md`

As of the May 2026 GitHub README, the CLI is a scriptable, JSON-first App Store Connect API tool for TestFlight, builds, submissions, signing, analytics, screenshots, subscriptions, and related workflows. The skills repo is a community-maintained, unofficial agent-skill pack and is not affiliated with Apple.

## When To Use

Use the CLI route when:
- the user wants App Store Connect work reduced to commands instead of clicks
- a new app record, bundle ID/App ID, or first upload path needs deterministic preflight before any browser/manual fallback
- app IDs, build IDs, version IDs, localizations, TestFlight groups, or screenshot localization IDs need deterministic resolution
- metadata, localizations, keywords, screenshots, or review status need repeatable audit/apply flows
- App Store listing preparation needs dry-run metadata, localization, screenshot, subscription, custom product page, or In-App Event state checks
- TestFlight distribution, build upload, or release readiness must be preflighted
- Apple Developer account, bundle ID/App ID, app record, signing, certificate/profile, or first upload state needs deterministic inspection
- RevenueCat catalog/subscription mapping needs reconciliation against ASC products

Still create `STORE_CONSOLE.md` and `store-console.html`. The CLI can automate or verify pieces, but the founder-facing copy-paste packet remains the durable handoff.

## Skill Pack Routing

When installed, route to these skill areas:
- `asc-cli-usage`: canonical commands, flags, output, pagination, auth
- `asc-workflow`: repo-local `.asc/workflow.json`, dry-run, validation, hooks, conditionals
- `asc-app-create-ui`: app record creation by browser automation when API coverage is missing
- `asc-xcode-build`: archive/export/build-number workflows
- `asc-shots-pipeline`: simulator screenshot capture, framing, staged upload
- `asc-release-flow`: readiness, staging, validation, submission blockers
- `asc-signing-setup`: bundle IDs, capabilities, certificates, profiles
- `asc-id-resolver`: app/build/version/group/tester ID resolution
- `asc-metadata-sync`: metadata/localization pull, validate, dry-run, apply
- `asc-localize-metadata`: locale-aware metadata translation and review-before-upload
- `asc-aso-audit`: offline ASO audit against canonical metadata
- `asc-whats-new-writer`: release notes and localization
- `asc-submission-health`: preflight, digital-goods readiness, review monitoring
- `asc-testflight-orchestration`: groups, testers, beta distribution
- `asc-build-lifecycle`: build processing and retention
- `asc-ppp-pricing`: purchasing-power-pricing workflows
- `asc-subscription-localization`: IAP/subscription display-name localization
- `asc-revenuecat-catalog-sync`: reconcile ASC products with RevenueCat
- `asc-screenshot-resize`: current screenshot size matrix, alpha stripping, resize, and validation
- `asc-crash-triage`: TestFlight crashes and beta feedback
- `asc-notarization`: macOS Developer ID archive/export/notarization when a macOS launch is in scope
- `asc-wall-submit`: optional Wall of Apps public submission, always founder-approved

For App Store listing work, also load `app-store-listing-prep.md`. CLI automation can apply or verify pieces of the listing, but the durable deliverable still needs `APP_STORE_LISTING.md`, `app-store-listing.html`, `STORE_CONSOLE.md`, and founder-visible approval gates.

Treat `asc-app-create-ui` as the expected app-record creation route when the API route is missing or the upstream skill pack says browser automation is required. That still counts as ASC CLI skill-pack routing; it is not a reason to declare the task impossible.

Install only with founder approval if it is not already available:

```bash
npx skills add rorkai/app-store-connect-cli-skills
```

## CLI Routing

Use JSON output for agent automation:

```bash
asc auth status --validate
asc auth doctor
asc apps list --output json --pretty
asc apps info view --app "123456789" --output json --pretty
asc versions list --app "123456789" --output json
asc localizations list --app "123456789" --type app-info --output json
```

Common workflows from the current README:

```bash
asc validate --app "123456789" --version "1.2.3"
asc review status --app "123456789"
asc review doctor --app "123456789"
asc metadata pull --app "123456789" --version "1.2.3" --platform IOS --dir "./metadata"
asc metadata validate --dir "./metadata" --output table
asc metadata push --app "123456789" --version "1.2.3" --platform IOS --dir "./metadata" --dry-run --output table
asc metadata keywords diff --app "123456789" --version "1.2.3" --platform IOS --dir "./metadata"
asc screenshots sizes --all --output table
# For each approved SCREENSHOTS.md row, validate the exact final dir, locale, and current ASC device_type.
asc screenshots validate --path "./screenshots/final/en-US/<device-well>" --device-type "<ASC_DEVICE_TYPE>" --output table
# Upload only after founder approval, version-localization IDs are resolved, and every iPhone/iPad row is validated.
asc screenshots upload --version-localization "LOC_ID" --path "./screenshots/final/en-US/<device-well>" --device-type "<ASC_DEVICE_TYPE>" --output json
asc testflight feedback list --app "123456789" --paginate
asc testflight crashes list --app "123456789" --sort -createdDate --limit 10
asc workflow validate
asc workflow run --dry-run testflight_beta VERSION:1.2.3
```

Before any first-time app creation claim, refresh and record the exact creation path from `asc apps --help`, `asc bundle-ids --help`, and the ASC skill pack. If the current route is `asc-app-create-ui` rather than a direct API command, record the browser automation preflight and founder gate in `STORE_CONSOLE.md`.

Use `--dry-run` and read commands first. Do not use `--confirm`, `--submit`, pricing changes, screenshot replacement, metadata apply, TestFlight external distribution, or release actions without explicit founder approval.

## ASC Auth Setup And Recovery

"I cannot access App Store Connect" is almost always wrong when the `asc` CLI is installed — it usually means auth is **not set up yet**, which is a fixable step, not a dead end. Work this ladder before reporting ASC as blocked:

1. **Check what's actually wrong.** `asc auth status --validate --output json` and `asc auth doctor`. A common output is `Error: ... missing authentication. Run 'asc auth login' or create ~/.asc/config.json (see 'asc auth init')` with the hint to set `ASC_KEY_ID` / `ASC_ISSUER_ID` / `ASC_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH`. That is a setup instruction, not an access denial.
2. **Look for an existing keychain profile first.** Founders often already have an API key stored under a named profile (e.g. from another app on the same team). List/try profiles and use `asc --profile <Name> <cmd>` (e.g. `asc --profile Clueless apps list`). One App Store Connect API key is **account/team-level — it can read and mutate every app on the team**, so an existing profile from another app works for this app too. Do not declare "no ASC access" before checking for an existing profile.
3. **Do not `source` a credential/profile `.env` blindly.** Profile env files often contain shell-unsafe values (an unquoted brand name like `Clueless Clothing` makes `source clueless.env` throw `command not found: Clothing`, which then breaks **every** `asc` call). Instead: use `asc --profile <Name>`, or extract the three vars with the awk pattern in [`secrets-management.md`](secrets-management.md) ("Env file extraction — never `source`"), or run `asc auth init` (writes `~/.asc/config.json`) / `asc auth login`.
4. **Set the env vars if no profile exists.** The `asc` CLI reads `ASC_KEY_ID`, `ASC_ISSUER_ID`, and `ASC_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` (the **path** to the `.p8`, not the key contents). Route these through Doppler/keychain; never print the `.p8`.
5. **Distinguish "not authenticated" from "this app/record/cert doesn't exist yet."** Healthy API read access plus `apps list` not showing the app means the **app record must be created** (via `asc-app-create-ui`/the app-create route, founder-gated) — not that ASC is inaccessible. Same for a missing distribution certificate, provisioning profile, or RevenueCat app: each is a setup step with a precise next command.
6. **Report blockers as setup steps with the exact next action and founder gate** — e.g. "ASC read access healthy via profile `X`; app record for `com.acme.app` does not exist yet → next: create app record (founder approval)". Never write "cannot access ASC." (Failure card: `asc-auth-not-set-up`.)

## Verified Command Cookbook

These notes exist because agents repeatedly burned live-store cycles guessing flag and subcommand forms. The CLI evolves — treat every form below as "confirm with `--help` first," not as memorized fact.

- **Pre-use `--help` rule.** Before the first use of any `asc` subcommand not shown in this file, run `asc <subcommand> --help` and record the confirmed flags. If a command errors on a flag, run `asc <cmd> --help` before retrying — never retry a mutating command with a guessed alternate flag. (Failure card: `asc-flag-drift`.)
- **`--confirm` is a CLI-required gate, not just a founder gate.** Destructive/mutating commands (`asc review cancel`, `asc review submit`, `asc subscriptions review submit`, release actions) error and do nothing unless `--confirm` is passed. So they need *both* the CLI `--confirm` flag *and* explicit founder approval before you run them. Omitting `--confirm` does not "safely no-op into a dry run" — it just errors; check `--help` for the required flags before the first live call.
- **`validate` form.** Validation runs against an app + version, e.g. `asc validate --app <APP_ID> --version <VERSION_STRING>` (confirm `--version` vs a numeric `--version-id` with `asc validate --help`). There is no `asc validate app-store-version` subcommand — that guess errors. Resolve the numeric version id first with `asc versions list --app <APP_ID> --output json` when a command needs `--version-id`.
- **Auth env vars.** The `asc` CLI reads `ASC_KEY_ID`, `ASC_ISSUER_ID`, and `ASC_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` (the **path** to the `.p8`, confirmed from the CLI's own auth hint — not the key contents). Keep these names consistent with `PROJECT_STATE.yaml`. See "ASC Auth Setup And Recovery" above for the full auth ladder (keychain profiles, account-level keys, `asc auth init/login`). Do not `source` a `.env`/`clueless.env` that contains comments or unquoted values — that throws `command not found` on every invocation; extract single values with the awk pattern in [`secrets-management.md`](secrets-management.md) ("Env file extraction — never `source`").
- **Internal TestFlight groups auto-distribute.** Internal groups deliver to all internal testers automatically; do not pass a skip flag unless you intend to block internal delivery. External distribution always needs founder approval.
- **Test notes are idempotent updates.** Updating a build's test notes is an update, not a create — do not create a second build record when one already exists.

## Promoted In-App Purchase Images

If any in-app purchase or subscription is **promoted** on the App Store (or has a promotional image attached), each promoted product needs its own **unique 1024×1024 promotional image that depicts that specific product**. Reusing the app icon, or the same image across weekly/yearly/lifetime products, triggers a Guideline 2.3.2 "Accurate Metadata" rejection. Generate distinct on-brand images (Higgsfield tied to `DESIGN.md`), set each via the ASC IAP/subscription image route (confirm the exact verb with `--help`), or remove the promotional image for products you will not promote. (Failure card: `asc-promoted-iap-image-duplicate`.)

Each unique promotional image should be generated with `higgsfield generate create gpt_image_2` using a DESIGN.md brief that names the specific product and its price point. Record every generated asset (prompt brief, output path, approval status) in `CONTENT_ASSETS.md`. See `app-store-listing-prep.md` for the full IAP asset workflow.

## App Store URL → Ad Creative Seeding

A live App Store URL can seed a Higgsfield Marketing Studio webproduct entity, which the Click-to-Ad pipeline then uses to generate a batch of UGC/product-review ads without a separate product-import step:

```bash
higgsfield marketing-studio webproducts fetch --url <app store url> --wait
```

The `--url` Click-to-Ad shortcut bypasses DESIGN.md brief injection by default — always pass `--prompt` with explicit DESIGN.md tokens, and confirm spend per `paid-tool-routing.md` before generation. See the **App Store URL → UGC Ad Batch (Click-to-Ad)** recipe in `tool-recipes.md` for the full sequence (webproduct fetch → avatar pick → spend confirm → parallel `marketing_studio_video` modes → virality scoring → CONTENT_ASSETS.md → founder approval). For paid campaign context, see `paid-user-acquisition.md`.

## Post-Action State Update

After any ASC action that changes build, metadata, screenshot, TestFlight, custom product page, in-app event, subscription, or platform state, update `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` (`updated_at`, the relevant lane status/evidence, build number, and upload status) and re-render `launch-cockpit.html` before the session ends — write any new `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md` evidence to the file rather than leaving it in chat. Skipping this is the `project-state-stale-after-upload` failure card.

## First-Time Signing And App Record Triage

Load `apple-signing-release.md` before this section. The common first-time failure is that the app builds in the simulator but cannot be uploaded because account/app-record/signing prerequisites are missing.

Before running a mutating app-record command such as `asc apps create`, show the founder the exact preflight packet from `apple-signing-release.md`: Apple ID/ASC user, platform, app name, primary locale, bundle ID, SKU, user access, developer-name implications, and name-collision plan. Do not let an interactive prompt become the first place the founder sees these values.

Run non-mutating checks first:

```bash
asc auth status --validate --output json
asc auth doctor
asc apps list --output json --pretty
security find-identity -v -p codesigning
xcodebuild -showBuildSettings -scheme MyApp -configuration Release | rg 'PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER|DEVELOPMENT_TEAM|CODE_SIGN_STYLE|CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY|PROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER|CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION|MARKETING_VERSION'
```

If App Store Connect API tools are exposed, check both resources before creating anything:

```text
GET /v1/apps?filter[bundleId]=<bundle-id>&limit=10
GET /v1/bundleIds?filter[identifier]=<bundle-id>&limit=10
```

Interpretation rules:

- `asc auth status` with no credentials means CLI automation is blocked until the founder authenticates or approves an API-key route through `SECRETS.md`.
- An interactive `asc apps create` prompt that fails with EOF is an auth/input blocker, not a reason to retry blindly.
- If `asc apps create` asks for Apple ID password or 2FA, the founder enters those directly in the secure prompt. Do not ask them to paste credentials into chat, logs, docs, or issue comments.
- If the CLI reports that the app name is already in use and offers or applies a fallback such as `<Name> - app`, stop before accepting that fallback unless the founder already approved it in the preflight packet.
- No bundle ID and no app record means create the explicit App ID/bundle identifier first, then create the app record, after founder approval.
- Blank `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` means project signing is not attached to an Apple team.
- Only `Apple Development` identities means local development can work, but App Store/TestFlight distribution still needs Xcode automatic signing/cloud-managed distribution signing or an Apple Distribution certificate/profile.
- `Bundle ID` and `SKU` should be treated as sticky identity. Do not create production records against placeholder naming.

Record all findings in `APPLE_SIGNING.md` and mirror app-record blockers in `STORE_CONSOLE.md`.

## Safe Automation Boundaries

Safe without new approval when credentials are already configured and the user asked for ASC work:
- read app/build/version/review status
- resolve IDs
- run validators and doctors
- export metadata or screenshots for review
- run dry-runs
- produce diffs and plans

Founder approval required:
- authentication or credential creation
- keychain bypass or repo-local credential storage
- app creation
- bundle ID/capability/certificate/profile creation or rotation
- metadata apply/push
- screenshot upload/replace
- IAP/subscription creation, pricing, localization, or attachment
- custom product page creation, keyword assignment, deep link submission, disable/delete, or review submission
- In-App Event creation, schedule/media/deep link changes, purchase-required flag changes, or review submission
- App Privacy publish/update actions
- TestFlight external distribution
- final submit, cancel, release, phased release, or managed publishing changes
- Wall of Apps submission or any public PR/post

If ASC CLI is missing, use `paid-tool-routing.md` before falling back to manual App Store Connect instructions. The user may want to install or use the CLI rather than receive a manual-only packet.

## Store Packet Integration

`STORE_CONSOLE.md` should show both routes when ASC CLI is in scope:
- CLI route: command, dry-run/apply status, JSON artifact path, blocker
- Console route: click path, field, paste value, source, founder gate

`store-console.html` should still show the founder where values live in App Store Connect. When a CLI command can update a value, show a "CLI available" note and the exact dry-run/apply distinction.

For screenshot upload:
- plan screenshots with `SCREENSHOTS.md`
- use real app captures from MobAI or confirmed XcodeBuildMCP fallback
- use design-system frames, headline/copy overlay, App Icon/App Preview routing, and iPhone/iPad device-well exports for final compositions
- use `asc-screenshot-resize` before upload to get the current size matrix, strip alpha, resize only after target selection, and validate final files
- use `asc-shots-pipeline` only after the screenshot matrix is approved and version-localization IDs are resolved

For RevenueCat:
- use `asc-revenuecat-catalog-sync` or equivalent audit before creating products or mappings
- do not create products, change prices, or map entitlements without founder approval and `REVENUE_OPS.md`

For localization:
- use `asc-metadata-sync` to pull canonical metadata before edits
- use `asc-localize-metadata` for listing metadata and keyword adaptation
- use `asc-subscription-localization` for subscription/IAP display names and descriptions
- do not upload translated keywords without character-limit validation and market-specific keyword review

For pricing:
- use `asc-ppp-pricing` for territory pricing and purchasing-power-pricing plans
- start in summary/dry-run/import mode; pricing changes require founder approval because they affect money, taxes, and public store behavior

For release health:
- use `asc-submission-health` and `asc-release-flow` for `asc validate`, digital-goods readiness, encryption/content-rights checks, App Privacy advisory, and review monitoring
- use `asc-build-lifecycle`, `asc-testflight-orchestration`, and `asc-crash-triage` during beta and post-upload monitoring

For App Store marketing surfaces:
- use CLI/API reads and dry-runs to resolve localization IDs, screenshot set IDs, IAP/subscription IDs, custom product page IDs, In-App Event IDs, and app version IDs
- keep manual click paths in `app-store-listing.html` even when CLI apply is available
- do not skip App Privacy, age rating, accessibility labels, review notes, or product attachment checks because metadata dry-run succeeded

## Evidence Requirements

Record in `STORE_CONSOLE.md`:
- CLI version/source checked
- auth status without secrets
- app ID, version ID, localization IDs, build IDs, and TestFlight group IDs resolved
- commands run
- output paths
- dry-run vs applied status
- founder approvals
- remaining manual console steps
- official Apple doc refresh date

Record in `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md` when release work is in scope:
- build upload or processing status
- validation/review doctor result
- TestFlight status
- screenshot upload status
- metadata apply status
- final submission blocker list

## Common Failure Modes

- Using `asc` to mutate metadata or screenshots without a dry-run and founder approval.
- Treating a CLI success response as proof the App Store product page is ready without checking privacy, age rating, IAP, accessibility, review notes, screenshots, and build attachment.
- Keeping stale `asc` command snippets after the upstream CLI or skill pack changes; refresh `asc --help`, the Rork skills repo, and official Apple docs before setup or apply commands.
- Losing track of localization IDs and uploading screenshots to the wrong locale.
- Storing App Store Connect credentials in committed files.
- Using unofficial skill-pack guidance without refreshing official Apple docs for the current required fields.
- Skipping `store-console.html` because CLI automation exists.
