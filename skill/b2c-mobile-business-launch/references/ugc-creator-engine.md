# UGC Creator Engine

Use this when the launch depends on TikTok/Reels/Shorts, creator-led organic growth, founder-led content, UGC ads, or post-launch social distribution. This reference factors in the user-provided Sprout UGC Playbook Part 1 PDF, extracted as "Zero to One: How a UGC engine actually starts" by Aaron Paul, published May 2026.

The Day 0 frame: do not build a mature creator machine before a format works. Run a 90-day founder-led format-discovery experiment with a tiny roster, high feedback intensity, and strict stop/scale rules.

Load `viral-growth-loops.md` first when UGC depends on product-led referral/share mechanics, social-comment loops, paywall timing, creator codes, or share-to-unlock behavior. This file owns creator operations; `viral-growth-loops.md` owns the product/content/revenue/analytics system that makes attention compound.

## Fit Gate

UGC is a good candidate when the app has:
- a visible product moment that can be shown in a phone screen, laptop screen, demo, or screenshot
- an emotional hook: anxiety, frustration, desire, identity, aspiration, relief, embarrassment, pride
- a large consumer or prosumer audience
- a natural comment-bait tension or share/tag reason
- a product name or visual identity that viewers can recognize from the video frame

Deprioritize UGC when:
- there is no visible product moment
- the product is pre-product or has no real workflow to film
- the audience is narrow, committee-led, or high-ticket enterprise
- the category is regulated and claims/compliance cannot be reviewed
- the product cannot tolerate rough, fast, creator-native presentation

Record the fit decision in `UGC_PLAYBOOK.md` and map it to `LAUNCH_TRACE.md` and `11_STAR_EXPERIENCE.md`. A creator hook should be a tiny, truthful version of the product's V1 scalable slice, not a separate marketing fantasy.

## Day 0 Operating Model

Run Day 0 as a format-discovery experiment:
- commit to 90 days before judging the channel
- use 3-5 creators, not a large roster
- expect roughly 3-4 approved videos per creator per week
- plan for 9-12 approved videos per week across a 3-creator roster
- write every script for the first 4-8 weeks
- approve every early cut before posting
- give same-day, specific, time-coded feedback
- give each format 5-8 reps before judging it
- look for a format that hits 2-3 times, ideally across 2+ creators, before scaling

Do not hire a large agency, buy production gear, build a heavy attribution stack, or run a 20-creator roster before the first repeatable format appears.

## Creator Sourcing

The first search target:
- personal TikTok accounts with roughly 500-5,000 followers
- US, UK, Canada, Australia, or whichever geography matches the paying buyer and pricing
- camera-native, clear speakers, reliable responders, coachable, comfortable with feedback
- not necessarily niche experts; the founder trains the niche through scripts

Day 0 sourcing workflow:
1. Open a founder/brand creator account and post 5-10 niche videos before recruiting, if feasible.
2. Scout roughly 100 creators on TikTok or an approved creator marketplace.
3. Use paid-tool routing before using Sideshift or another paid creator platform.
4. Keep the first DM short, lead with paid collaboration, explain the app in one concrete line, and ask for email/phone rather than closing in DMs.
5. Expect a small percentage of cold DMs to become onboarded creators.

Creator-owned personal audience is not the point. The creator runs a new niche-themed account for the program. The algorithm, not their existing follower base, is the distribution engine.

## Onboarding And Contracts

Compress week 1:
- Day 1: sign a short contractor agreement before account credentials change hands
- Day 2: creator creates the new niche-themed brand account on their own device and shares login as backup
- Day 3: founder sends scripts in the simplest shared doc/text thread that works
- Days 4-7: creator films, founder reviews, creator revises, then posts
- end of week 1: quick async check-in and first iteration notes

Contract checklist for Day 0:
- brand/account ownership and handover
- content usage and paid-ad reuse rights
- base pay, bonus trigger, view source, and measurement window
- termination terms and in-flight bonus handling
- tax forms and payout method
- disclosure requirements: commercial relationship, partner language, hashtags, and platform rules

Get legal review before scale. Do not leave account ownership, ad usage, or tax paperwork ambiguous.

## Payment Shape

The Day 0 payment structure should keep creators engaged while the program has no proven hit rate:
- base pay per approved video
- performance bonus after a meaningful view threshold
- no pure-performance-only structure at Day 0
- no affiliate or rev-share-first structure before a repeatable format exists

Sprout PDF benchmark to adapt, not blindly copy:
- base: roughly $30-40 per approved video
- bonus trigger: meaningful breakout at around 50K views
- rough flat bonus after the trigger, then tune to category economics
- later scale can use declining CPM tiers so mega-hits do not destroy unit economics

Budget planning:
- floor: base-only spend for 3 creators over 13 weeks
- working case: base plus mid-hit bonuses
- breakout case: monthly spend can jump sharply, which can be a success signal if unit economics work

Any real creator spend, paid platform spend, legal spend, or payout commitment is founder-approved.

## Format Discovery Loop

Test:
- hooks: first 1-3 seconds, usually the highest-leverage variable
- formats: talking-head, demo, POV, skit, fake interview, street, duet, teardown, before/after, challenge
- angles: pain, aspiration, identity, objection, comparison, result, use case
- characters: self, expert, beginner, skeptic, exaggerated persona, antagonist, customer, friend
- CTA mechanic: comment bait, tag/share, profile search, waitlist, app search, store link, demo request

Define a format as a repeatable structure, not a topic. A format includes hook shape, beat order, product insertion, tension, and CTA mechanic. Steal the skeleton from proven patterns, not the skin, lines, scenes, or copyrighted material.

Daily research habit:
- scout TikTok and adjacent niches for 20-30 minutes
- save repeated structural patterns, not one-off viral videos
- look for 3+ unrelated examples with high view counts
- turn each candidate into 5-8 scripts before judging

Breakout rules:
- 5K views: signal worth inspecting
- 10K views: stronger signal
- 50K+ views: likely breakout and bonus trigger
- one hit: luck
- 2-3 hits from the same structure, ideally across 2+ creators: format worth scaling
- after a breakout: clone the hook and structure within 24 hours

Stop rule:
- after 3 months at full cadence, no 100K-ish breakout, no improving format, no install/branded-search lift, and no audience-fit comments means shut down or reposition the channel
- creator has not posted by day 7: replace
- creator ghosts, resists feedback, or sends low-effort work in week 1: replace
- positioning changes every week: freeze it and run 10-15 videos before evaluating

## Tracking And Analytics

Day 0 tracking can stay simple:
- one Google Sheet or equivalent
- creator
- account handle
- post URL
- date/time
- format ID
- hook variant
- angle
- CTA
- product visibility
- views at 24h, 72h, 7d, 30d
- comments/theme notes
- install/branded-search spike notes
- payout status

This does not replace launch analytics. Use `analytics-attribution.md` for UTMs, creator/referral codes, self-reported attribution, PostHog events, store CTAs, RevenueCat/Stripe conversion, and weekly growth dashboards. Day 0 UGC is intentionally lightweight on attribution, but the launch package still needs measurement once links, waitlists, stores, or purchases are involved.

## Design And Product Implications

Before filming:
- make the app logo or name visible in screenshot-heavy screens
- identify which 11-star magical moment or V1 scalable slice the video is demonstrating
- ensure the product moment can be captured in a short screen recording
- design UI states that are legible inside vertical video
- avoid tiny copy that disappears in phone-shot footage
- prepare a truthful demo account/fixture with realistic data
- mark any generated or mock UI as non-production until the real app exists

Use Higgsfield only for supporting visuals, mascots, backgrounds, hooks, or motion after `DESIGN.md` exists. Do not use generated visuals as a substitute for truthful app UI in store screenshots or product claims.

**Synthetic founder-voice content (before real creators are onboarded).** Marketing Studio supports four UGC-family modes suited to pre-roster founder-led content: `ugc`, `ugc_how_to`, `ugc_unboxing`, and `product_review`. Use these to generate synthetic founder-voice ads during format discovery before a real creator roster is running. Synthetic UGC complements real creator content — it does not replace it; real creators produce authentic human variability, comment-bait tension, and niche credibility that generated video cannot replicate. See the **Soul-Once Founder-Face Ads** recipe in `tool-recipes.md`.

Guardrails for synthetic UGC:
- Requires a trained founder Soul (`soul-cinematic` variant) and a custom avatar; see `tool-recipes.md`.
- Every generation prompt must carry `DESIGN.md` tokens (palette, type mood, shapes, texture, motion energy, banned aesthetics, surface). Generating without this brief is a named failure mode.
- Gate every generation behind spend confirmation per `paid-tool-routing.md`; surface current balance first (`mcp__claude_ai_Higgsfield__balance`).
- Record all generated assets in `CONTENT_ASSETS.md` / `content-assets/manifest.json` with `prompt_brief`, `soul_reference_id`, `avatar_id`, and `virality_score` fields.
- Synthetic ads must pass brain-activity virality scoring before paid distribution (see **Virality Closed Loop** recipe in `tool-recipes.md`).
- Public posting and paid campaign launch remain founder-gated.

**Long recordings → short clips (`personal_clipper`).** Use `personal_clipper` to cut long founder recordings, podcast appearances, demo walkthroughs, or app explainers into short-form clips for UGC distribution. `personal_clipper` is an MCP-tool capability only (`mcp__claude_ai_Higgsfield__personal_clipper_create` / `_jobs` / `_status`); confirm the exact invocation via the `higgsfield-generate` skill before running. Gate behind spend confirmation per `paid-tool-routing.md`. See the **Master → All Platforms** recipe in `tool-recipes.md`.

Use Remotion when founder-led or creator-led content needs repeatable local variants: product-demo loops, hook overlays, captions, cutdowns, screenshot motion, before/after frames, or app-preview clips. Load `remotion-content-assets.md` first, record Remotion license status, keep real app UI visible, and add each rendered output to `CONTENT_ASSETS.md` and `content-assets/manifest.json`. Remotion is especially useful before Fastlane because the same composition can render many hook, CTA, locale, and dimension variants without paying for net-new generative media.

## Outputs

Create these when UGC is in scope:
- `UGC_PLAYBOOK.md`: fit decision, 90-day plan, budget, creator profile, sourcing channel, contract checklist, payment model, stop/scale rules
- `VIRAL_GROWTH.md`: product-led loop, referral/share mechanics, content format lab, monetization timing, analytics proof, abuse controls, and stop/scale rules when creator content is expected to compound
- `CONTENT_ASSETS.md`: Remotion/Higgsfield/raw-media route, source inputs, license status, render proof, and output registry when rendered or generated media supports the UGC lane
- `ugc/creator-list.csv`: creators, platform, handle, geography, personal followers, notes, outreach status
- `ugc/script-bank.md`: format IDs, hooks, scripts, CTA notes, product insertion notes
- `ugc/tracker.csv` or sheet link: posts, metrics, payouts, format results
- `ugc/creator-brief.md`: filming rules, disclosure rules, approval flow, account handling, product truth constraints
- `ugc/weekly-review.md`: current winners, failed hooks, next tests, spend, install/search signals
- updated `FASTLANE_OPS.md` when Fastlane becomes the generation/scheduling engine after launch

## Common Failure Modes

- Scaling to 20+ creators before one format works.
- Asking creators to invent strategy before the founder understands the medium.
- Optimizing for production polish before hook strength.
- Changing positioning every few videos.
- Using affiliate links or rev share too early and forcing unnatural CTAs.
- Treating one viral video as a format.
- Forgetting product/logo visibility in the app screens shown on video.
- Scheduling UGC or creator posts without disclosure, claim review, and founder approval.
- Spending on paid creator tools or marketplaces without a founder-approved tool decision.
