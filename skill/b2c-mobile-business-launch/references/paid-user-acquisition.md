# Paid User Acquisition

Use this before planning paid ads, Apple Search Ads, Meta/TikTok/Google campaigns, web-to-app paid traffic, custom product page campaign routing, paid creative tests, MMP/ad-network SDK choices, or any launch claim that the app is ready to spend on acquisition.

This reference factors in RevenueCat's May 2026 article, "How to build a UA system when you're a one-person team": https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/growth/how-to-build-a-ua-system-when-youre-a-one-person-team. Treat it as a practical solo-founder operating model, not universal law. The transferable shape is small, complete, measurable, and cadence-driven: one channel, creative production, tracking, and schedule.

Paid spend is a founder-only gate. Agents may prepare the system, docs, creative plan, dashboards, and stop/scale rules, but must not launch campaigns, connect ad accounts, change budgets, create paid trials, or commit spend without approval.

Load `paid-tool-routing.md` before replacing paid ASO/MMP/ad tools, ad-network accounts, RevenueCat paid features, PostHog paid features, or App Store/Play/Google/Meta/TikTok account data with free or manual reporting. Load `analytics-attribution.md`, `revenue-monetization.md`, and `app-store-listing-prep.md` when paid UA touches tracking, LTV/CPA, store conversion, screenshots, or ad creative. Update `CONTENT_ASSETS.md`; load `remotion-content-assets.md` when Remotion-rendered ad creative or repeatable variants are involved.

## Fit Gate

Paid UA is plausible when:
- the app has a real store/beta/web destination that can accept traffic
- onboarding and paywall flow can convert paid visitors without contradicting store, privacy, or subscription copy
- RevenueCat or the approved subscription source can show LTV, trial starts, cohorts, and entitlement truth
- analytics can distinguish landing/store clicks, installs or opens, onboarding, paywall reach, purchase/trial, entitlement activation, and retention
- the product has at least 3-5 truthful creative angles tied to the 11-star V1 slice
- the founder has approved a test budget and account access path

Defer or reject paid UA when:
- store pages, privacy/terms, support, pricing, or purchase validation are not ready
- no baseline period exists for RevenueCat, App Store Connect, PostHog, and self-reported attribution
- the launch cannot absorb traffic because onboarding, paywall, restore, support, or crash/error monitoring is weak
- the only plan is "try ads" without a channel, creative cadence, target event, dashboard, and stop rule
- paid spend or ad-account access is unapproved

Record the fit decision in `PAID_UA.md`, update `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` `lanes.paid_user_acquisition`, and trace the decision into `LAUNCH_TRACE.md`.

## One-Channel Choice

Start with one paid channel. Do not launch Meta, TikTok, Google, and Apple Ads at the same time unless the founder has a team or explicit reason to absorb separate creative, reporting, account-management, and attribution costs.

Default channel choice:
- **Meta Ads**: default first channel for many subscription apps when the ICP is broad enough and the product can produce varied visual/pain-point creatives.
- **TikTok**: consider when the buyer is younger, the product has strong native video hooks, and the launch can refresh creatives faster.
- **Google web-to-app**: consider when search/demand capture or web funnels matter and the app can preserve campaign context into checkout or install.
- **Apple Ads**: consider when search intent is clear, keyword economics are plausible, and App Store listing/custom product pages are ready.

Document:
- selected channel and why
- rejected channels and why now is too early
- target event: usually trial, direct subscription, paywall-qualified event, or another high-intent proxy; avoid install-only campaigns as the main growth pillar unless the launch explicitly uses them for creative testing
- campaign destination: store listing, custom product page, web funnel, landing page, or web purchase link
- founder-approved budget cap and date range, or blocker if not approved

## Creative Production System

Before spend, define the first creative batch:
- 3-5 new assets per week for an early solo cadence
- one ad group or equivalent simple structure for the first test
- angle map: pain, aspiration, identity, objection, comparison, proof, result, or use case
- product visibility: real app UI, store screenshot, app-flow recording, Remotion render, or approved generated/supporting asset
- copy and claim constraints from `APP_STORE_LISTING.md`, `PRIVACY.md`, `TERMS.md`, `REVENUE_OPS.md`, and `SECURITY.md`
- each creative tied to `11_STAR_EXPERIENCE.md`, `CONTENT_ASSETS.md`, and `LAUNCH_TRACE.md`

Use `remotion-content-assets.md` when repeatable ad variants, motion screenshots, captions, cutdowns, or local render proof are needed. Use Higgsfield only after design-system constraints and paid-tool routing are recorded. Use real app UI wherever a user must inspect the actual product.

### Higgsfield Creative Production

Before generating any Higgsfield asset: confirm spend with the founder per `paid-tool-routing.md`, carry `DESIGN.md` tokens (palette, type mood, shapes, texture, motion energy, banned aesthetics, surface) in every prompt, and record every output in `CONTENT_ASSETS.md`.

**Routed recipes** (bodies in `tool-recipes.md` — do not re-copy here):
- **App Store URL → UGC Ad Batch (Click-to-Ad)** — webproducts fetch → avatar pick → parallel mode batch → score → save winners → founder approval.
- **Virality Closed Loop** — generate → score → decision rules → iterate → record → paid distribution only after a score is recorded.
- **Cheap-First Direction** — z_image drafts → pick direction → production model → founder selects. Apply only when presented as a spend-reduction option at the spend-confirmation prompt; never silently.

**DTC static-ad batch path.** Browse available formats first (`higgsfield marketing-studio ad-formats list`), then:
```
higgsfield marketing-studio dtc-ads generate --format-id <id> [--brand-kit-id <id>] [--batch-size 1..20]
```
`--format-id` is mandatory. `--brand-kit-id` requires a prior paid brand-kit fetch — confirm spend before running.

**Hook A/B protocol.** Before committing to a production run, test breadth before depth: run 4 hooks × 1 mode first to find the winning hook, then 1 hook × 4 modes to find the winning mode. Score each variant with `brain_activity` before expanding.

**Click-to-Ad `--url` note.** The `--url <app-store-url>` shortcut bypasses brief injection — `DESIGN.md` tokens are NOT carried automatically. Always inject them explicitly into `--prompt`.

**Win-back / re-engagement creatives.** For lapsed-user campaigns, generate `marketing_studio_video --mode product_review` ads with "do you miss X" hooks, plus `product-photoshoot --mode lifestyle_scene` static re-engagement visuals; score the video with `brain_activity` before allocating any spend. Record `virality_score` and `hook_dmn_risk` in `CONTENT_ASSETS.md` before distributing.

## Tracking And Baseline

Do not require a large MMP by default for the first solo paid-UA test. Decide the minimum tracking stack from current product phase:
- RevenueCat for LTV, cohorts, subscription events, trial starts, purchase state, and entitlement truth
- selected ad-network SDK or native reporting when the channel requires it
- App Store Connect or Google Play Console for store/source signals
- PostHog for product analytics, identity, attribution, funnels, and dashboards
- a simple spreadsheet or `growth/paid-ua-report.csv` for the blended weekly report

Create a baseline before campaign launch:
- RevenueCat daily trials, purchases, revenue, cohorts, and LTV
- App Store Connect or Play installs/product page views where available
- PostHog events from app open through onboarding, paywall, purchase, entitlement, activation, and retention
- self-reported attribution answers from onboarding/signup/waitlist
- current organic/social traffic notes so uplift is not confused with paid performance

For iOS, document that ad-platform attribution can under-report or over-report. Use baseline uplift across RevenueCat, ASC, PostHog, and self-reported attribution instead of pretending attribution is perfect.

## Blended Report

Create a weekly report that lets the founder decide whether to continue, pause, or scale.

Minimum columns:
- date
- channel
- campaign
- spend
- impressions
- clicks
- installs or app opens
- onboarding starts
- paywall views
- trial starts
- purchases
- entitlement active count
- revenue
- RevenueCat LTV window
- CPA or cost per trial/direct subscription
- blended ROAS or projected payback
- winning angle
- virality_score (brain_activity overall)
- hook_dmn_risk (Default Mode risk from brain_activity)
- notes and next action

The report should compare paid traffic against organic baseline and category benchmarks where available. It should be good enough to catch product-side drop-offs, not only media-buying changes.

## Weekly Schedule

Use a calm twice-weekly operating cadence for low-budget tests instead of reactive daily edits:
- Monday: refresh campaign and blended report, compare against previous week, decide pause/keep/scale candidates, and choose one paywall/onboarding test hypothesis.
- Tuesday: plan and produce the next 3-5 creative assets from winning or unresolved angles.
- Wednesday: check early creative delivery, pause older non-spending or clearly weak assets only when there is enough signal, and upload 1-2 replacements.
- Thursday: quick anomaly and report check.
- Friday: upload remaining assets when needed, then decide whether to scale, hold, reduce, or pause based on the full week.
- Daily: spend 15 minutes checking pacing and major anomalies only.

Automated ad-platform rules may be planned when supported, but live setup or budget changes require founder approval.

## Stop And Scale Rules

Stop, hold, or reposition when:
- baseline cannot be established
- spend is active but RevenueCat, ASC/Play, PostHog, and self-reported attribution disagree beyond the documented tolerance
- CPA cannot plausibly fit LTV, trial conversion, or payback window
- paywall reach, purchase conversion, entitlement activation, or retention drops versus organic traffic
- creatives are being changed faster than the budget can generate useful signal
- the only positive metric is impressions, clicks, or installs

Scale only after:
- one channel works at a meaningful founder-approved spend level
- one or more creative angles repeat with downstream revenue or activation evidence
- weekly creative production can keep up without lowering quality
- onboarding/paywall/revenue experiments and support paths are stable
- the founder approves higher spend or new channels

Outsource only after identifying the bottleneck:
- creative producer when asset production is slowing learning
- data analyst when reporting quality is the bottleneck
- part-time UA manager when campaign operations consume too much founder time

Outsource execution, not strategy, until the founder understands the channel economics.

## Founder-Only Gates

Always ask before:
- connecting ad accounts or creating campaigns
- installing or enabling ad-network SDKs that change privacy disclosures or ATT posture
- committing paid spend, changing budgets, or turning on automated rules that affect spend
- using paid MMP/ad/ASO tooling
- changing pricing, trials, intro offers, subscription terms, paywall behavior, or legal copy
- launching custom product pages, web funnels, web purchase links, or public ad creative
- sharing screenshots, creator/founder likeness, generated assets, or claims publicly

## Outputs

Create or update:
- `PAID_UA.md`: fit gate, channel choice, creative system, tracking baseline, blended report, schedule, stop/scale rules, founder-only gates, and traceability
- `growth/paid-ua-report.csv` when spend is planned or active
- `ANALYTICS.md` and `analytics-plan.html` with campaign, ad-network, baseline, and RevenueCat/ASC/PostHog dashboard definitions
- `REVENUE_OPS.md` with LTV/CPA/payback assumptions and RevenueCat cohort source
- `CONTENT_ASSETS.md` and optional Remotion/Higgsfield artifacts for repeatable creative production
- `APP_STORE_LISTING.md`, `STORE_CONSOLE.md`, or custom product page notes when the campaign destination is a store surface
- `LAUNCH_TRACE.md` rows connecting research, 11-star slice, channel, creative angles, paywall/revenue, analytics, privacy/legal, and proof

Run:

```bash
npm run check:paid-ua -- --root .
```

## Common Failure Modes

- Marking paid acquisition ready while ad spend is still unapproved.
- Launching multiple channels before one channel has a creative/reporting loop.
- Treating install volume as success while paywall reach, purchase, entitlement, and retention are unknown.
- Adding a paid ad SDK without updating analytics, privacy, ATT, store disclosures, and `SECRETS.md`.
- Using RevenueCat products and paywalls without checking whether CPA can fit LTV and trial conversion.
- Scaling creative volume before the app has real product UI, clear claims, and repeatable angle evidence.
- Copying a big-team MMP/reporting stack when the first solo test only needs a small complete system.
- Calling paid UA "done" while `PAID_UA.md`, `ANALYTICS.md`, `REVENUE_OPS.md`, `CONTENT_ASSETS.md`, `APP_STORE_LISTING.md`, or `LAUNCH_TRACE.md` disagree.
