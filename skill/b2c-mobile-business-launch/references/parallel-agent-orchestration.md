# Parallel Agent Orchestration

Use this before any broad launch run, multi-lane app build, skill audit, or production-readiness sweep where parallel agents, subagents, specialist role prompts, or worktrees could move faster without losing control.

This reference turns the agent's default question from "what do I do next?" into "what can safely run in parallel while I keep the critical path moving?"

Current synthesis for this skill:

- Start with a strong single orchestrator. Split only when tool overload, context separation, independent breadth, or specialist consistency justifies the coordination cost.
- Prefer a manager pattern for B2C launches: one orchestrator owns the user thread, state, integration, git, provider mutations, and release calls.
- Use parallel subagents for breadth-first work and bounded independent units, not for shared-file editing, device/simulator control, account mutations, or final launch decisions.
- Treat subagents as tools with narrow objectives, explicit inputs, output contracts, forbidden actions, and blast-radius limits.
- Parallelism is not free. It can burn tokens, duplicate work, create merge conflicts, and make hidden assumptions harder to catch unless the orchestrator records the plan and reconciles outputs.
- Keep `AGENTS.md` as the short map over the harness: source docs, active plans, validations, and failure cards. Repeated orchestration misses should become mechanical checks or LaunchBench scenarios.

## Subagents Vs Dynamic Workflows

This reference covers Claude's turn-by-turn subagents and worktrees, where the orchestrator holds the plan in its context. When the runtime is Claude Code and a stage needs dozens-to-hundreds of agents, a codified repeatable quality pattern (adversarial verification, tournament, loop-until-done), or a run you want to read and rerun, use a **Dynamic Workflow** instead — the plan moves into a script the runtime executes in the background, and only the final answer returns to context. Workflows are the preferred shape for the heavy *pre-build* stages on the Claude side of the Claude-vs-Codex split; subagents here are the fallback when workflows are unavailable, disabled, or below Claude Code v2.1.154. See [`dynamic-workflows.md`](dynamic-workflows.md). Either way, the adversarial-verification and quarantine shapes still apply — only the runtime changes.

## Required Preflight

Before substantial launch work starts, write or update `ORCHESTRATION.md` and the `orchestration` block in `PROJECT_STATE.yaml`. At the start of a new session, resume, status check, or handoff, also update the Session Continuity block from `AGENTS.md`, `PROJECT_STATE.yaml`, `launch-cockpit.html`, `ORCHESTRATION.md`, `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`, `FAILURE_CARDS.md`, and `git status --short`; chat memory is not source truth.

The orchestrator must answer:

1. What is the immediate critical path I should do locally?
2. What independent sidecar work can run in parallel without blocking that path?
3. Which work needs specialist consistency rather than generalist attention?
4. Which files, repos, providers, devices, or accounts are shared resources?
5. Which tasks must be serialized because they mutate the same source of truth?
6. What proof will show subagent findings were reviewed, integrated, and validated?

If the answer is "no useful parallelism," record `strategy: inline` with a short reason. If the runtime lacks a callable subagent facility, record `strategy: blocked` or `inline` with `subagents_unavailable` in the rationale and run the role audits serially or inline from `APP_AGENTS.md`. The preflight still matters because it proves the agent considered parallelism deliberately.

**MCP catalog overflow (a common silent subagent failure).** When many MCP servers are connected, the combined tool catalog can overflow a subagent's context before it starts — the subagent returns empty with ~0 tokens in a few seconds, or fails with "Prompt is too long." If a dispatched subagent exits in under ~5 seconds with no output, treat it as a context-overflow signal, not a task result. Mitigation: prefer `strategy: inline` for MCP-tool-heavy research (run it in the parent session); if background dispatch is required, enable on-demand tool loading (e.g. `ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH=true`, which typically needs a client restart) and confirm it is active before dispatch. Record the overflow and the chosen mitigation in `ORCHESTRATION.md`; do not silently retry the same dispatch.

## Strategy Choices

Use the smallest strategy that fits the work:

- `inline`: one orchestrator does the work. Use for small edits, urgent critical path, or tightly coupled tasks.
- `serial_subagents`: specialists run one at a time for context isolation or independent review, but each result feeds the next step.
- `parallel_subagents`: independent agents run at the same time with disjoint write scopes or read-only audit scopes.
- `worktrees`: implementation lanes run in isolated git worktrees when parallel edits would otherwise collide.
- `hybrid`: parallel read-only audits plus serialized implementation, or worktrees for code and one serialized device/provider owner.
- `blocked`: orchestration would help, but access, repo state, or missing source truth prevents safe dispatch.
- `not_needed`: the app has no real build, audit, or multi-lane launch work in scope.
- `not_evaluated`: no orchestration preflight has happened yet; do not treat this as approval to run broad work inline.

Default for broad B2C launch work is `hybrid`: the orchestrator continues the critical path locally while read-only or isolated specialists inspect independent lanes. Do not silently run broad multi-lane work fully inline when a subagent-capable runtime is available.

## Good Parallel Units

Parallel agents are useful when each unit has a clear output and does not need another unit's unfinished result:

- market/review research, social-language research, web/SEO research, and competitor pricing scans
- ASO metadata audit, app privacy/data inventory, analytics event catalog, and onboarding critique
- design-system audit, accessibility review, content-asset route review, and screenshot matrix review
- RevenueCat/Stripe entitlement review, Resend lifecycle review, PostHog attribution review, and security threat-model review
- frontend implementation in one repo and backend implementation in a different repo
- test fixture creation, static validator authoring, and documentation updates when file ownership is disjoint
- LaunchBench prompt review against known failure modes

## Work To Serialize

Do not parallelize these unless they are isolated in separate worktrees and the orchestrator owns final integration:

- edits to `PROJECT_STATE.yaml`, `launch-cockpit.html`, `AGENTS.md`, `ENGINEERING_PLAN.md`, `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`, or release notes
- migrations plus code depending on the migration state
- MobAI, Codex Desktop native iOS, XcodeBuildMCP, serve-sim, or simulator/device automation on the same target device
- App Store Connect, Google Play, RevenueCat, Stripe, Resend, PostHog, DNS, domain, Fastlane, or social-account mutations
- git staging, committing, merging, rebasing, tagging, pushing, release submission, or public posting
- final production-readiness, pricing, legal, security acceptance, or launch decisions

## Parallel Safety Check

Before dispatching parallel agents:

1. List every candidate unit.
2. For each unit, record `agent_type`, objective, expected output, input docs, create/modify/test paths, shared resources, and verification command.
3. Build a file-to-unit map from declared paths.
4. Mark any overlapping file, directory, provider, device, or account as serialized.
5. Confirm every parallel code-edit unit has a disjoint write set or a separate worktree.
6. Confirm every parallel audit unit is read-only unless assigned an isolated patch.
7. Add the exact forbidden actions to each prompt.
8. Record the preflight in `ORCHESTRATION.md` and `PROJECT_STATE.yaml`.

After agents return:

1. Compare actual modified files across agents.
2. Re-run any colliding units serially on the integrated tree.
3. Review each output against its requested format and source docs.
4. Apply or reject findings deliberately.
5. Run focused validators first, then full launch validators.
6. Update `PROJECT_STATE.yaml`, failure cards, and `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`.

## Standard Subagent Instructions

Every parallel subagent prompt should include:

```text
You are not alone in this repo. Do not revert or overwrite work by other agents.
Your assigned objective: <objective>.
Read first: <specific docs/files>.
Allowed write scope: <paths> or read-only.
Forbidden actions: do not stage files, commit, push, merge, run project-wide suites, mutate providers, change credentials, post publicly, submit builds, or make founder-only decisions.
Output exactly:
- docs/files read
- findings or changes
- files changed, if any
- validation run or validation recommended
- blockers and failure cards
```

For read-only audits, set `Allowed write scope: none`.

For code-edit workers, include disjoint paths and tell them to list changed files in the final answer. The orchestrator stages, commits, runs full suites, and pushes.

## B2C Launch Dispatch Map

Use this dispatch map when a launch request is broad and the repo/runtime permits subagents.

| Lane | Parallel role | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Product | product leader | scope risks, onboarding/activation fixes, traceability gaps |
| Marketing | marketing guru | ASO/GEO/UGC/Fastlane claims and channel findings |
| Design | design guru | design-system, screenshot, accessibility, Higgsfield/Remotion asset gaps |
| Engineering | engineering leader | implementation risks, test plan, frontend/backend/provider proof gaps |
| Security | security architect | threat model, app integrity, entitlement/webhook, supply-chain, incident response gaps |
| Customer success | customer success | support, privacy/delete/refund/restore, lifecycle, review-response gaps |
| Orchestrator | main agent | state, integration, file collision check, git/release, final proof |

Specialists review and propose by default. They implement only with an explicit assignment, a disjoint file scope, and an integration plan.

## State Contract

Add this top-level block to `PROJECT_STATE.yaml`:

```yaml
continuity:
  last_state_review: "not_reviewed"
  source_files:
    - "AGENTS.md"
    - "PROJECT_STATE.yaml"
    - "launch-cockpit.html"
    - "ORCHESTRATION.md"
    - "PRODUCTION_READINESS.md"
    - "FAILURE_CARDS.md"
  git_status_reviewed: false
  next_action: "Reconstruct state from durable repo artifacts before choosing work."
  drift_risks: []
orchestration:
  preflight_done: false
  strategy: "not_evaluated"
  rationale: "No orchestration preflight has been evaluated yet."
  integration_owner: "orchestrator"
  manager_pattern: true
  file_overlap_checked: false
  actual_file_collision_check: false
  agent_outputs_reviewed: false
  state_reconciled: false
  candidate_units: []
  parallel_safe_units: []
  serialized_units:
    - "PROJECT_STATE.yaml updates"
    - "git staging, commits, merges, pushes, and releases"
    - "provider/account mutations"
    - "MobAI, Codex Desktop native iOS, XcodeBuildMCP, serve-sim, or simulator/device control"
  spawned_agents: []
  focused_validators_run: []
  full_suites_run: []
```

`candidate_units` entries should use:

```yaml
- id: "analytics-audit"
  role: "analytics specialist"
  objective: "Audit attribution contract and event proof."
  mode: "read_only"
  files:
    - "ANALYTICS.md"
    - "PROJECT_STATE.yaml"
  parallel_safe: true
  shared_resources: []
  output: "findings"
  status: "pending"
```

`spawned_agents` entries should use:

```yaml
- id: "agent-or-runtime-id"
  role: "security architect"
  objective: "Audit security release hardening."
  mode: "read_only"
  allowed_files: []
  forbidden_actions:
    - "stage"
    - "commit"
    - "provider mutation"
  status: "completed"
  output_path: "orchestration/security-audit.md"
```

## Required Artifacts

`ORCHESTRATION.md` must include:

- Orchestration Preflight
- Strategy
- Candidate Units
- Parallel Safety Check
- File Ownership
- Serialized Work
- Subagent Instructions
- Integration Plan
- Verification
- Founder-Only Gates
- State Updates
- Failure Cards

`orchestration.html` is optional but recommended when the founder needs a visual board of lanes, blockers, assigned agents, and proof.

## Done Rules

Parallel orchestration is done only when:

- the selected strategy is recorded with rationale
- no parallel unit has undeclared overlapping files or shared mutable resources
- subagent prompts include forbidden actions and output shape
- actual returned file changes were compared before integration
- subagent findings are accepted, rejected, or converted into failure cards
- focused validators and the full relevant suite are recorded
- `PROJECT_STATE.yaml`, `launch-cockpit.html`, `ORCHESTRATION.md`, and `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md` agree on current state

If any of these are missing, keep the orchestration state `partial` or `blocked`. Do not call the app launch-ready from parallel activity alone.
