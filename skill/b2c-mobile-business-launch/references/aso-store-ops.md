# ASO And Store Operations

Use this before writing App Store or Google Play metadata, producing screenshots, running paid-search experiments, submitting builds, handling review issues, or monitoring growth after launch.

This is an orchestration reference. Prefer specialist ASO skills and live store data when available; use this file to decide which lane to run and what evidence must be left behind.

For App Store listing preparation, load `app-store-listing-prep.md` too. ASO decides what to say; App Store listing prep connects that message to Apple pre-ASC requirements, App Privacy, subscriptions/pricing, RevenueCat/Stripe/web funnels, custom product pages, In-App Events, localization, screenshots, and App Store Connect policy constraints. For founder-facing App Store Connect or Google Play Console work, load `store-console-workflow.md` too; the store-console workflow decides exactly where the user clicks, what they paste, which privacy answers are selected, and which screenshots/assets satisfy each upload well.

Load `paid-tool-routing.md` before replacing paid ASO, AppKittie, MobAI, creator-marketplace, or MMP/ad tooling with a free fallback. Load `apple-signing-release.md` before Apple Developer account triage, bundle IDs/App IDs, signing, certificates/profiles, archive/export/upload, TestFlight, or distribution-readiness claims. Load `app-store-connect-cli.md` before using the Rork `asc` CLI or App Store Connect CLI skills for metadata, screenshots, TestFlight, release validation, signing, subscriptions, or RevenueCat catalog sync.

## 1. Specialist Skill Delegation

If an ASO skill pack is installed, delegate narrow work instead of re-creating its frameworks:

- Foundation and routing: `aso-router`, `app-marketing-context`.
- Market and category: `market-pulse`, `market-movers`, `category-positioning`, `competitor-analysis`, `competitor-tracking`.
- Keywords and metadata: `keyword-research`, `metadata-optimization`, `localization`, `seasonal-aso`, `android-aso`.
- Creative conversion: `screenshot-optimization`, `app-icon-optimization`, `app-preview-video`, `ab-test-store-listing`.
- App Store growth surfaces: `custom-product-pages`, `in-app-events`, `app-store-featured`, `app-clips`.
- Paid acquisition and attribution: `apple-search-ads`, `ua-campaign`, `attribution-setup`.
- Revenue and funnel quality: `monetization-strategy`, `paywall-optimization`, `subscription-lifecycle`, `web-to-app-funnel`.
- Activation and retention: `onboarding-optimization`, `retention-optimization`, `referral-program`.
- Ratings, reviews, and quality: `review-management`, `rating-prompt-strategy`, `crash-analytics`, `app-rejection-recovery`.
- Analytics and first-party performance: `app-analytics`, `asc-metrics`.
- Launch and publicity: `app-launch`, `creator-ugc-marketing`, `press-and-pr`.

If these skills are not directly discoverable in the current runtime, search installed skill/plugin paths for the names above, read the matching `SKILL.md`, and proceed with the same output contract manually. Do not assume Claude and Codex expose the same installed plugin surface.

Before handing work back to the founder, produce or update `STORE_CONSOLE.md`, `store-console.html`, `APP_STORE_LISTING.md`, `APPLE_APP_STORE_REQUIREMENTS.md`, `SCREENSHOTS.md`, and the screenshot/export proof board when a store submission is in scope.

## 2. Required ASO Context

Create or refresh `app-marketing-context.md` or an equivalent section in `LAUNCH.md` before metadata or screenshots.

Include:
- app name, bundle/platform, target country, category, subcategory, and launch status
- one-line promise, target user, core job, and monetization model
- top 5-10 competitors with app IDs/package names when possible
- primary, secondary, long-tail, competitor, and defensive keyword candidates
- category economics and audience language evidence
- current listing fields, screenshots, ratings, reviews, price, and IAP/subscription state if the app already exists
- public URLs: landing page, support URL, privacy URL, terms URL, account deletion/privacy choices URL

Acceptance:
- Metadata, screenshots, ads, and landing copy all draw from the same context.
- A future agent can identify which market/country the ASO work targets.

## 3. Metadata And Keyword Gates

Before locking metadata:
- run keyword and name collision checks in the target country
- separate brand language from search language
- preserve App Store character counts and Play Store indexed-description strategy
- avoid unsupported health, financial, legal, earnings, urgency, scarcity, endorsement, or superiority claims
- ensure pricing, trial, subscription, and cancellation language matches the paywall, store metadata, terms, and checkout behavior
- create 2-3 variants when uncertainty is real, with a recommendation and rationale

Output:
- final fields ready for App Store Connect/Play Console
- rejected alternatives with reasons
- keyword map showing where each target appears
- source URLs or data snapshots used for evidence

## 4. Screenshot And Creative Gates

Screenshots must sell the product and satisfy platform rules.

Checklist:
- define the first 3 screenshots as the search/product-page conversion set
- treat raw app screenshots as proof inputs, not final store creative
- produce composed final assets with headline, copy overlay, device frame or intentional frameless layout, background/supporting visuals, export dimensions, and visual QA
- show actual app UI or faithful production screens; do not rely on generic generated art
- capture real app UI with MobAI or an equivalent simulator/device workflow when a local build exists
- use XcodeBuildMCP for Apple-platform screenshot capture only after the founder confirms fallback from MobAI
- make the value proposition readable at thumbnail size
- use current iPhone, iPad, Google Play, and app-target device sizes/upload wells required for the current platform
- route App Icon work through `app-icon-optimization` or equivalent, and verify 1024x1024 output, no alpha, no rounded corners, thumbnail contrast, and category differentiation
- route App Preview or Play promo videos through `app-preview-video` plus MobAI/Remotion/Higgsfield/owned-media production rules when video is in scope
- ensure screenshots do not imply unavailable features, unsupported claims, free trials, prices, competitor comparisons, or endorsements without approval
- localize screenshot copy when localized metadata is shipped
- mark reference art separately from production upload assets
- express the V1 scalable slice from `11_STAR_EXPERIENCE.md` instead of generic feature lists

Output:
- `SCREENSHOTS.md` with narrative, raw capture matrix, production composition matrix, device wells, App Icon, App Preview, validation, and visual QA
- screenshot frame table: slot, headline, copy overlay, source screen, visual asset, proof constraint, production file path, locale/device target
- MobAI/raw capture paths, composed asset paths, final upload paths, and the device/display wells each file satisfies
- final image dimensions and upload status
- `screenshots/index.html` or equivalent self-contained proof/export board when assets are being composed locally
- content-asset route, license/source-input proof, and founder approval gate when Higgsfield, Remotion, or edited media are used
- visual QA notes from desktop and mobile inspection where applicable

## 5. App Store Listing Marketing Surface

For iOS launches, create or update `APP_STORE_LISTING.md` before final App Store Connect work.

Required Apple marketing surfaces:
- default product page fields: name, subtitle, promotional text, description, keywords, support URL, marketing URL, categories, age rating, screenshots, previews, review notes, and release option
- App Privacy mapping from the actual data inventory, SDK/vendor behavior, analytics, support, payments, AI, backend, and email flows
- pricing and subscription mapping across App Store Connect, RevenueCat, Stripe/web funnels, paywalls, terms, screenshots, and analytics
- custom product page strategy by audience/channel/keyword set, including deep links and measurement plan
- In-App Event strategy only when the app has real event content, schedule, media, deep link, localization, and App Review readiness
- localization matrix for metadata, keyword fields, screenshots, privacy/support URLs, and cultural review
- visual asset route: real app UI captures first, Higgsfield for high-quality supporting art/icons/backgrounds/CPP/event imagery when needed, always tied to `11_STAR_EXPERIENCE.md` and `DESIGN.md`

Use the ASO skill set when available: `app-marketing-context`, `keyword-research`, `metadata-optimization`, `screenshot-optimization`, `custom-product-pages`, `in-app-events`, `localization`, `apple-search-ads`, `review-management`, `monetization-strategy`, and `subscription-lifecycle`.

Output:
- `APP_STORE_LISTING.md`
- `APPLE_APP_STORE_REQUIREMENTS.md`
- `app-store-listing.html`
- `app-privacy-questionnaire.html` when privacy answers are not already proven
- updated `STORE_CONSOLE.md`, `SCREENSHOTS.md`, `REVENUE_OPS.md`, and `LAUNCH_TRACE.md`

## 6. Store Console Readiness

Do not treat ASO as copy only. App Store Connect or Play Console readiness is part of launch.

Load `store-console-workflow.md` and refresh official Apple/Google docs before producing final console packets. Console fields, privacy categories, screenshot wells, target API rules, and review tasks change over time.

Apple checklist:
- bundle ID, SKU, category, age rating, availability, pricing, IAP/subscriptions, review notes, demo credentials, export compliance, and build status are known
- privacy policy URL and optional privacy choices/account deletion URL are live
- App Privacy responses match the actual data inventory and third-party SDKs
- `APPLE_APP_STORE_REQUIREMENTS.md` proves privacy manifest and required-reason API declarations, third-party SDK manifests/signatures, Xcode privacy report, purpose strings, ATT, account deletion, review notes, and upload warnings for the app and bundled SDKs
- Accessibility Nutrition Labels are answered or intentionally deferred, and any claimed support is backed by common-task testing on each supported device
- account deletion is available in-app when accounts can be created
- Sign in with Apple token revocation is handled when Sign in with Apple is used
- screenshots and app previews match current App Store Connect specs
- phased release/manual release/automatic release choice is explicit
- final submission or resubmission is founder-approved

Google Play checklist:
- package name, category, content rating, target countries, pricing, subscriptions/IAP, testing track, and release status are known
- privacy policy URL is active, public, non-geofenced, non-editable, and not a PDF
- Data safety answers match actual collection, sharing, retention, deletion, security, and vendor behavior
- account deletion web resource exists when accounts can be created
- feature graphic, screenshots, short description, long description, and store listing experiments are prepared
- App content declarations, app access instructions, sensitive-permission declarations, and pre-launch report status are tracked before production release
- staged rollout/managed publishing choice is explicit

Output:
- `STORE_CONSOLE.md` with click paths, field limits, paste-ready values, evidence, statuses, and blockers
- `store-console.html` with copyable fields grouped by ASC/Play Console page
- `APP_STORE_LISTING.md` and `app-store-listing.html` when an iOS App Store listing is in scope
- `APPLE_APP_STORE_REQUIREMENTS.md` when an iOS App Store Connect upload path is in scope
- `SCREENSHOTS.md` with device capture, dimension, locale, proof, and upload state
- required links and which console fields use them
- final founder-only approval list

## 7. App Store Connect CLI Routing

Use `app-store-connect-cli.md` when the ASC CLI or skill pack can reduce manual work.

Good uses:
- read app/build/version/review status
- resolve IDs
- export or dry-run metadata
- audit keywords
- validate release readiness
- plan screenshots
- inspect TestFlight feedback/crashes
- reconcile ASC products with RevenueCat before applying changes

Founder-gated uses:
- app creation
- metadata apply/push
- screenshot upload/replace
- product/subscription/pricing changes
- signing asset changes
- external TestFlight distribution
- final submission/release/cancel actions

Even when `asc` is used, produce `STORE_CONSOLE.md` and `store-console.html` with manual click paths, paste values, and founder-only approvals.

## 8. Support, Privacy, And Email Routing

Every launch needs working contact routes before public listing, legal pages, or review submission.

Minimum aliases:
- `support@domain` for app support, store review contact, refunds/help, and public footer
- `privacy@domain` for privacy policy, data rights, account deletion, and regulator/store disclosures
- `security@domain` when the app handles accounts, payments, sensitive data, or user content
- `hello@domain` or `contact@domain` for partnerships, press, and general inbound
- founder alias only when the founder wants a public personal route

Cloudflare Email Routing checklist:
- verify destination addresses first
- create custom address rules for each alias
- connect/enable Email Routing at the zone level; individual rules can appear active while global status or DNS records are still disabled
- add or let Cloudflare add the required `MX` and `TXT` DNS records
- keep catch-all disabled/drop unless the founder intentionally wants it monitored; catch-all can increase spam and accidental PII intake
- send tests from an external email account, not the same destination inbox
- verify delivery to inbox and spam, record timestamps and destination
- document outbound behavior separately: Cloudflare Email Routing is inbound forwarding; use a real mailbox, SMTP provider, Cloudflare Email Service, or transactional email provider for sending as the domain

Output:
- alias table: address, purpose, destination, status, last tested, source page/store field
- DNS/routing status evidence
- any send-as or transactional email gap

## 9. Review And Rejection Playbook

When a store review issue occurs:
- read the exact rejection/message and store-console status
- map it to binary behavior, metadata, screenshots, privacy labels, data deletion, IAP/subscription setup, review notes, or account credentials
- reproduce the reviewer path on a clean install where possible
- patch the smallest correct surface
- update `LEGAL_REVIEW.md`, `LAUNCH.md`, screenshots, metadata, or app code as needed
- verify final console state after resubmission because wrapper/API tools can report noisy intermediate errors

Do not stop at advice when the user asks to take care of a rejection end to end. Operationalize the fix, verify the console state, and leave handoff notes.

## 10. Post-Launch Growth Loop

Run a weekly loop for the first 6-8 weeks after launch:
- keyword rank deltas and new keyword opportunities
- conversion rate by product page and screenshot set
- ASA search term mining and negative keywords
- ratings, review themes, and response queue
- crash-free sessions and support volume
- subscription funnel: trial starts, conversion, cancels, refunds, yearly/monthly mix
- competitor metadata, screenshot, ranking, ad, pricing, and review changes
- localization opportunities by country revenue/downloads

Output:
- weekly change log
- prioritized experiments
- decision list for founder-only spend/pricing/submission calls
