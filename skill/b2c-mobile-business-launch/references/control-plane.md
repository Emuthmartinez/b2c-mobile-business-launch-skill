# Business Control Plane

The Design Room is the first panel of a larger Business Control Plane: a founder-facing layer above the actual business where state, decisions, proof, blockers, and rendered views stay connected.

## Current Panel

`design-room.html` and `dist/design-room/` render the Design Room from:

- `state/business.json`
- `state/theme.tokens.json`
- `state/schema/business.schema.json`

The portable workspace read model renders from:

- `state/business.json`
- `PROJECT_STATE.yaml`
- `state/schema/workspace.schema.json`
- `scripts/render-business-control-plane-workspace.ts`

This panel owns cross-surface design state: app screens, web funnels, marketing assets, App Store pages, Product Page Optimization tests, In-App Events, and shared theme tokens.

## Modeled Panel Shells

The Design Room is active now. The next Control Plane panels are modeled as state-backed shells now, with deeper implementation deferred until the Design Room loop remains stable:

- **Analytics**: activation, attribution, conversion, retention, and experiment dashboards.
- **Monetization**: RevenueCat/Stripe products, entitlements, paywalls, trials, refunds, and LTV/CPA evidence.
- **Store Ops**: App Store Connect/Google Play readiness, screenshots, privacy answers, review notes, releases, CPPs, PPO, and In-App Events.
- **Growth**: paid UA, creator/UGC, Fastlane, referral/share loops, and content cadence.

Each shell must live in `state/business.json` under `controlPlane.panels`, include `stateRefs`, include `renderedArtifacts`, and appear in `design-room.html`. Future panel depth should read the same state store and theme tokens rather than inventing parallel docs.

## Architectural Rules

- Use JSON state when humans need line-level git diffs, baselines, and restore.
- Render views from state; do not hand-author dashboard HTML.
- Keep panel-specific detail in references and scripts, not `SKILL.md`.
- Let `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` remain the launch lane/status cockpit while `state/business.json` grows into the cross-surface business model.
- Let `render-business-control-plane-workspace.ts` adapt both files into the open Business Control workspace schema instead of teaching UI code to scrape each source directly.
- Add validators before adding new panels so the Control Plane does not become another long prose checklist.
- Run `check-control-plane-contract` and `check:business-control-plane-workspace` whenever panel state changes.

## Promotion Path

When a Design Room decision is accepted:

1. Commit the state and render.
2. Run `promote-design-tokens` when theme tokens changed, then commit `design-system/tokens.json`, `design-system/tokens.css`, and `design-system/DesignTokens.swift`.
3. Cascade the accepted decision to canonical business docs such as `DESIGN.md`, `design.md`, `APP_STORE_LISTING.md`, `ONBOARDING.md`, `CONTENT_ASSETS.md`, and `REVENUE_OPS.md` only when those files are in scope.
4. Update `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` if launch readiness changed.
5. Render both `design-room.html` and `launch-cockpit.html` when both state layers changed.
6. Re-render the Business Control workspace read model and run `check:business-control-plane-workspace` before calling it maintained.
