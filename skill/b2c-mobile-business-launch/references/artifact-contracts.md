## `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` And `launch-cockpit.html`

Use `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` for every multi-lane launch, continuation, builder handoff, or launch-readiness audit. It is the compact state contract for agents and validators; `launch-cockpit.html` is the founder-facing rendering of the same information.

Must include:
- project name, slug, owner, phase, platforms, bundle/package IDs, public URLs, and source-truth pointers
- autonomy mode, latest founder approval, and founder-only gates
- lane statuses with evidence paths and blockers
- paid/account-gated tool routes and provider setup state
- required secret names only, never values
- provider preflight, validation, fallback, docs checked date, and CLI/version basis when relevant
- analytics attribution contract completeness
- proof commands and evidence paths
- active and resolved failure cards
- top-level orchestration strategy, candidate units, serialized resources, spawned agents, collision checks, integration proof, and validator runs
- LaunchBench or validator run history when available

Acceptance:
- A future agent can tell which lane is blocked, partial, done, deferred, or not needed without rereading every artifact.
- The founder can open `launch-cockpit.html` and see what is proven, what is blocked, and what needs approval.
- No raw secrets, passwords, private keys, credential file contents, or real-looking placeholder values appear in the state or cockpit.
- State changes when provider setup, signing, analytics, revenue, email, store, or proof changes.

## `AGENTS.md`

Use the shipped `templates/repo-agent-entrypoints/AGENTS.md` as the starting point for generated business repos. Do not copy the skill repo's root maintainer `AGENTS.md` into a launch repo.

Must include:
- 60-second project brief
- an explicit instruction to continue using the `b2c-mobile-business-launch` skill for broad launch/business work without asking the founder to re-invoke it
- source-of-truth file map
- `PROJECT_STATE.yaml`, `launch-cockpit.html`, LaunchBench/failure-card rules, and the current autonomy mode contract
- `LAUNCH_TRACE.md`, `11_STAR_EXPERIENCE.md`, `11-star-experience.html`, and `TECH_SPEC.md` when they exist
- brand voice rules and banned/owned words
- `DESIGN.md` and HTML visual-proof enforcement rules
- onboarding, review prompt, paywall, closing offer, and activation rules when in scope
- architecture conventions
- V1 scope, V2/V3 scope, and banned scope
- analytics rules
- secret-management rules: `SECRETS.md`, Doppler or approved provider, `.env.example` names only, no raw secret values in docs/logs/proofs, and `doppler run --` or approved wrapper for secret-bearing commands
- security rules: `SECURITY.md`, `security-review.html`, threat model, security tool routing, OWASP MASVS/ASVS basis, mobile platform hardening, app-integrity decision, entitlement/webhook abuse controls, supply-chain checks, monitoring/incident response, accepted risks, and `check:security`
- Compound Engineering routing, `ORCHESTRATION.md`, safe parallel-agent/worktree rules, and when to use `ce-brainstorm`, `ce-plan`, `ce-work`, review, and proof skills
- app-local agent roster pointer to `APP_AGENTS.md` and `agents/`, including orchestrator ownership and specialist audit roles
- MobAI/device testing rules and serialized device ownership
- paid-tool routing and approved MobAI/XcodeBuildMCP fallback rules
- UGC/Fastlane growth rules when social distribution is in scope
- backend/frontend E2E and production-readiness gates
- common agent mistakes
- verification requirements

Acceptance:
- An agent can answer "what should I read first?"
- The file is business-specific: product, stack, repo paths, scope, provider state, and launch phase are filled for the current app.
- A future agent knows to load the next needed skill reference, update `PROJECT_STATE.yaml`, rerender `launch-cockpit.html`, and run validators before pausing for anything other than a founder-only gate.
- Banned scope is explicit enough to stop feature creep.
- Implementation rules are specific to the stack.
- A future engineering agent knows when to use parallel agents and when to serialize MobAI, git, migrations, releases, or shared-file edits.
- A future app-management agent knows which local role prompt owns product, marketing, engineering, design, or customer-success follow-up.
- A future agent updates `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` before claiming completion or crossing a launch phase.

## `APP_AGENTS.md` And `agents/`

Use for real app builds, generated-app handoffs, or post-launch management packages. Keep these lightweight; they are role entrypoints, not a second product spec.

Must include:
- one orchestrator role that owns source-of-truth docs, `PROJECT_STATE.yaml`, `launch-cockpit.html`, failure cards, sequencing, worktree/subagent safety, integration, git/release coordination, and `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`
- one marketing guru role for ASO, GEO/SEO, Fastlane, UGC, attribution learning, reviews, launch calendar, claims, and channel experiments
- one engineering leader role for `TECH_SPEC.md`, `ENGINEERING_PLAN.md`, frontend/backend/provider integration, test strategy, observability, and production-readiness evidence
- one product leader role for ICP, problem framing, V1/V2/V3 scope, onboarding, activation, retention loops, and evidence-to-product traceability
- one design guru role for `DESIGN.md`, `design.md`, `design.html`, `CONTENT_ASSETS.md`, visual QA, accessibility, screenshots, icons, motion, Higgsfield asset use, and Remotion rendered content
- one customer success role for support email, help/FAQ, privacy/delete/refund/restore paths, review responses, lifecycle copy, and feedback triage
- one security architect role for `SECURITY.md`, security tool routing, threat model, platform hardening, app integrity, abuse controls, scanner/review evidence, accepted risks, and incident response
- each role's inputs, outputs, forbidden actions, and when to ask the founder
- a note that role agents review and propose by default; implementation requires orchestrator assignment, file-overlap check, and integration proof

Minimum `agents/` files:
- `agents/orchestrator.md`
- `agents/marketing-guru.md`
- `agents/engineering-leader.md`
- `agents/product-leader.md`
- `agents/design-guru.md`
- `agents/customer-success.md`
- `agents/security-architect.md`

Acceptance:
- `APP_AGENTS.md` points each role to canonical docs instead of duplicating them.
- The orchestrator can launch parallel audits against the skill definition without letting specialists stage, commit, release, or edit overlapping files independently.
- Product, design, marketing, engineering, security, and support follow-up work has a named owner after bootstrap.

## `ORCHESTRATION.md` And `orchestration.html`

Use before broad multi-lane launch work, subagent dispatch, worktree routing, production-readiness sweeps, or app handoff prompts that imply parallel agents.

Must include:
- orchestration preflight: current objective, critical path kept local, selected strategy, manager-pattern owner, and rationale
- candidate units: role, objective, mode, expected output, input docs, files, shared resources, parallel-safe decision, and status
- parallel safety check: declared file overlap, shared mutable resources, serialized units, worktree needs, and actual file collision check after agents return
- file ownership: which files the orchestrator owns and which paths specialists may edit
- serialized work: provider/account mutations, credentials, device automation, git, releases, pricing/legal/public posting/submission, and final readiness decisions
- standard subagent instructions with forbidden actions: no staging, commits, pushes, merges, project-wide suites, provider mutation, device ownership, credential changes, public posting, submissions, or founder-only decisions
- integration plan: review outputs, accept/reject findings, resolve collisions, update state/failure cards, run focused validators, then full suites
- verification: focused validator commands, full-suite commands, proof paths, and unresolved blockers
- founder-only gates and active failure cards

Acceptance:
- `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` has a matching top-level `orchestration` block.
- Parallel-safe units do not share write files or mutable resources unless isolated in worktrees and integrated serially.
- Subagent outputs are reviewed before any done/readiness claim.
- The orchestrator owns `PROJECT_STATE.yaml`, `launch-cockpit.html`, `ORCHESTRATION.md`, `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`, git, provider/device mutations, and final launch judgment.
- `npm run check:orchestration -- --root .` passes or leaves named blockers/failure cards.

## `TOOL_DECISIONS.md`

Use when paid or account-gated tools affect research, visuals, testing, store ops, revenue, email, analytics, UGC, or post-launch growth.

Must include:
- tool and lane
- intended paid/account-gated workflow
- runtime access status
- founder confirmation or blocker
- selected route: paid, user export, free fallback, blocked, deferred
- fallback limitation and confidence impact
- downstream artifacts affected
- date checked

Acceptance:
- No fallback work is mistaken for the intended paid-tool workflow.
- A future agent can tell whether AppKittie, XPOZ, Firecrawl, Higgsfield, MobAI, Fastlane, paid ASO/MMP tools, creator marketplaces, RevenueCat, Stripe, PostHog, Resend, App Store Connect, or Google Play access was used, blocked, or intentionally bypassed.
- Founder-only spend, account, credential, posting, and submission decisions are explicit.

## `SECRETS.md`

Use whenever the launch uses API keys, tokens, OAuth credentials, webhook signing secrets, service-account files, app-store credentials, CI/deploy environment variables, mobile build secrets, local `.env` files, or provider CLIs.

Must include:
- selected provider: Doppler by default, or founder-approved alternative such as Apple Keychain, GitHub Actions secrets, Cloudflare/Vercel/Supabase secrets, Xcode Cloud secrets, or local `.env` fallback
- secret inventory: name, service, class, environment, runtime surface, public/server-only status, location, owner, rotation note, and status
- Doppler project/config map or alternate provider location for local, staging, and production
- command map for local dev, tests, builds, deploys, migrations, webhook replay, store automation, and support scripts
- CI/deploy map for `DOPPLER_TOKEN`, service tokens, provider integrations, OIDC, or platform-native secret injection
- new-secret routing log for secrets discovered during implementation
- founder-only actions and blocked secrets
- proof notes that record location and command evidence, never raw values
- matching `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` provider entries with required secret names, docs checked date, preflight, validation, and fallback limitations

Rules:
- Commit `SECRETS.md`, optional `doppler.yaml`, and optional `.env.example` with names only.
- Do not commit `.env`, `.env.local`, service-account JSON, `.p8`, `.p12`, provisioning files, OAuth refresh tokens, raw API keys, or downloaded credential files.
- Use `doppler run -- <command>` for local secret-bearing commands when Doppler is selected.
- Use Doppler service tokens, provider integrations, OIDC, or platform-native secrets for CI/live environments; do not use personal or local CLI tokens in production.
- When a new secret, `process.env`, `import.meta.env`, mobile build setting, webhook secret, provider key, or CI secret appears, update `SECRETS.md` before calling the work complete.

Acceptance:
- A future agent can run secret-bearing commands without asking where values live.
- No raw secret values appear in docs, commits, screenshots, logs, or readiness proof.
- Public client config is separated from server-only secrets.
- Production secret injection is different from local personal login.
- `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` and `launch-cockpit.html` show names-only secret requirements and provider status without exposing values.

## `SECURITY.md` And `security-review.html`

Use when a launch includes mobile code, backend state, public web surfaces, accounts, payments, email, analytics, store submission, or any provider that mutates user state.

Must include:
- source basis: current OWASP MASVS/MASTG, OWASP ASVS, Apple, Android, Sentry, Claude Security, Codex Security, MobSF, and scanner docs used where relevant
- security review tool routing: intended paid/account-gated routes, founder approval or blocked state, selected free fallback, and limitations
- threat model: assets, trust boundaries, attacker capabilities, abuse paths, mitigations, and non-capabilities
- data classification: public, user personal data, purchase data, secrets/signing material, logging and retention rules
- mobile hardening: iOS Keychain, App Transport Security, App Attest/DeviceCheck, entitlements/deep links; Android Keystore, Network Security Config, Play Integrity, exported components/deep links
- authentication and authorization, including anonymous/authenticated/subscriber/admin/deleted states
- backend/API controls: validation, authz/RLS, rate limits, idempotency, webhook signature verification, retries, admin access, and audit logs
- revenue/entitlement abuse controls for RevenueCat, Stripe, app-store purchases, restores, refunds, promo grants, and support-granted entitlements
- privacy/analytics controls: PostHog, session replay/surveys, PII scrubbing, attribution free text, Sentry, store disclosures, and data deletion
- email/domain controls: Resend, SPF, DKIM, DMARC, unsubscribe/preference handling, inbound/reply, webhook signing, support/privacy/security aliases, and `security.txt` when public users are in scope
- supply-chain and build controls: dependency review, SDK inventory, lockfiles, generated-code review, secret scans, CI, signing material, and no raw secrets
- monitoring and incident response: release health, alerts, rollback/kill switch, support escalation, store crash reports, public reporting route
- accepted risks: owner, reason, expiry or revisit date, compensating control, evidence, and founder approval where required
- release proof: validator/scanner/review outputs or blocked-route evidence

Rules:
- Do not call security done from prose alone.
- Do not silently replace Claude Security, Codex Security, GitHub Advanced Security, Snyk/Semgrep/Socket, MobSF Cloud, or commercial app-integrity tools with free fallbacks.
- Do not enforce App Attest, DeviceCheck, or Play Integrity in a blocking way until telemetry and founder approval support the rollout.
- `security-review.html` should render the plan and open risks for founder review, using the app's design system when available.

Acceptance:
- A future agent can identify security-critical flows and tests without re-threat-modeling the whole app.
- Store privacy answers, `PRIVACY.md`, `ANALYTICS.md`, `TECH_SPEC.md`, `REVENUE_OPS.md`, and `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md` agree with `SECURITY.md`.
- `npm run check:security -- --root .` passes or produces named blockers/failure cards.
- Remaining risks are explicit instead of hidden inside launch-readiness language.

## `LAUNCH_TRACE.md`

Use for any multi-artifact launch so the chain from research to implementation does not drift.

Must include:
- evidence index with source, date, tool/query/URL, confidence, and affected decision area
- decision trace table with stable IDs
- research finding, product experience decision, product decision, brand/design decision, build contract, analytics/revenue/privacy/store impact, verification method, and status
- rejected decisions and why
- founder-only decisions and approval status
- implementation blockers and proof blockers

Acceptance:
- A future agent can explain why each major screen, claim, onboarding question, paywall behavior, event, data collection, and store-console answer exists.
- The 11-star ladder and V1 scalable slice have trace rows before design and engineering harden.
- Brand/design work cites research/product trace rows.
- `ENGINEERING_PLAN.md`, builder prompts, and production-readiness checks can reference trace IDs instead of restating context.

## `11_STAR_EXPERIENCE.md` And `11-star-experience.html`

Use before `SPEC.md`, design, onboarding, ad/store concepts, content assets, or engineering plans are treated as ready. This is the product's experience north star, not a mood board.

`11_STAR_EXPERIENCE.md` must include:
- experience thesis: target user, ordinary world, desired transformation, magical moment, and why the user would retell it
- 1/2/5/6/7/10/11-star ladder with product-specific labels, user scenes, implied behavior, emotional reaction, and learning
- visible line of feasibility separating V1, light manual/concierge support, deferred inspiration, and explicitly not-in-scope ideas
- V1 scalable slice with product behavior, data/state/API needs, design/motion needs, analytics proof, and production-readiness proof
- surface matrix for product, onboarding, paywall, ad/creator hook, App Store screenshots, landing, lifecycle email, support, and engineering
- traceability rows that connect experience decisions to `RESEARCH.md`, `SPEC.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `ONBOARDING.md`, `TECH_SPEC.md`, `LAUNCH_TRACE.md`, and `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`

`11-star-experience.html` must include:
- visual vertical or staged ladder similar in structure to the 1/2/5/6/7/10/11-star framework, but with product-specific labels
- line of feasibility shown as a visible break or band
- V1 scalable slice summary
- surface translation board for product, onboarding, paywall, ads, App Store, landing/email/support, and engineering
- references to the canonical docs that consume the decisions

Acceptance:
- The product doc has a `11-Star Experience` section or pointer to this artifact.
- The visual board can be opened by the founder before implementation.
- The V1 slice is narrow enough to build but strong enough to shape design, ad creative, screenshots, onboarding, and technical contracts.
- `npm run check:11-star -- --root .` passes or leaves an active failure card.

## `TECH_SPEC.md`

Use when app, backend, or web-funnel implementation needs precise contracts beyond visual screen specs.

Must include:
- source docs and trace IDs
- 11-star V1 scalable slice and magical-moment contracts when the experience lane is in scope
- architecture overview and repo boundaries
- auth/session model, anonymous-to-known transition, roles, logout/reset behavior
- data model: entities, fields, ownership, retention, deletion, indexes, migrations, and seed fixtures
- API/RPC/webhook contracts: route, method, auth, request, response, errors, idempotency, rate limits, and retry behavior
- state machines: onboarding, account, entitlement, subscription, restore, deletion, support, lifecycle messaging, offline/cache
- permissions/platform capabilities and just-in-time prompts
- integration contracts for analytics, revenue, email, crash, backend, push, AI, Fastlane, store notifications, and support tools
- secret contract: environment variable names, public/server-only classification, secret-provider location, runtime injection path, and rotation/proof requirements
- app integrity/abuse decision: Apple App Attest/DeviceCheck, Google Play Integrity, bot/rate-limit protections, replay/idempotency protection when in scope
- remote config, feature flags, kill switches, staged/phased rollout controls, and test fixtures

Acceptance:
- A builder does not invent schema, endpoint, state, permission, provider, or fixture behavior.
- `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md` can test frontend/device actions against backend/provider truth.
- Privacy, store, analytics, and revenue disclosures trace to actual implementation behavior.

## `CLAUDE.md`

Use when Claude Code, Rork, or another builder expects Claude-specific guidance.

Use the shipped `templates/repo-agent-entrypoints/CLAUDE.md` as the starting point for generated business repos. Do not copy this skill repo's root maintainer `CLAUDE.md`.

Must include:
- one-line pointer that `AGENTS.md` is canonical
- one-line reminder to continue using `b2c-mobile-business-launch` for launch/business work without another founder prompt
- Claude-specific skill/plugin notes only when they differ from general agent guidance
- a warning not to duplicate product truth from `AGENTS.md`

Acceptance:
- Claude can find the same canonical docs without creating a second source of truth.
- Product, design, analytics, and engineering rules remain in `AGENTS.md` unless truly Claude-specific.

## `ANALYTICS.md`

Must include:
- vendor and identity model
- current PostHog docs checked, date checked, and stack-specific doc links
- PostHog host/region and project-grouping decision
- north-star metric and launch learning questions
- super-properties
- naming convention
- attribution model: UTMs, click IDs, referrer, deep links, referral/creator codes, vanity URLs, store/ad-platform limits, and self-reported source
- self-reported attribution data contract: stable source keys, `other` free text, `attribution_source_selected`, PostHog person properties, backend/profile fields, anonymous-to-identified reconciliation, and QA evidence
- web events if a landing funnel exists
- iOS/mobile events by flow
- backend/provider events for purchases, entitlements, webhooks, email, and referral truth
- email lifecycle events if Resend or another email provider is used
- subscription lifecycle events
- web checkout and entitlement events when RevenueCat/Stripe/web funnels exist
- funnel definitions and targets
- dashboard/insight definitions, feature flag and experiment registry, session replay/survey posture, privacy notes, and QA checklist
- dashboard and QA checklist

Rules:
- Use snake_case event names.
- Mirror events across surfaces when the concept is the same.
- Do not invent event names in build prompts; update the catalog first.
- Public analytics tokens may live in public bundles only when the vendor documents them as publishable/write-only. Service keys never go into git.
- Render `analytics-plan.html` before builder handoff or launch so the founder can inspect the measurement plan, attribution map, funnel cards, and blocked credentials visually.
- Do not call attribution wired if it only emits an event or updates local state; `self_reported_source` must reach PostHog person properties and backend/profile storage where identity exists.

## `ENGINEERING_PLAN.md`

Use when the actual app, backend, or web funnel will be implemented by Codex, Claude, Rork, or another builder.

Must include:
- origin docs, `LAUNCH_TRACE.md` IDs, and requirements trace
- product brainstorm source when `ce-brainstorm` was used
- `TECH_SPEC.md` pointer or an inline technical contract section when implementation contracts are in scope

- secret impacts: new/changed env vars, Doppler/provider routing, `.env.example` updates, CI/deploy injection, and bundle-safety checks
- test scenarios for each unit
- MobAI/device E2E scenarios
- backend/provider verification scenarios
- production-readiness gates and blockers

Acceptance:
- It can be passed to `ce-work` or a builder without re-deciding product behavior.
- It explains where parallel agents are safe and where orchestration must stay serial.
- It keeps implementation units tied back to launch docs rather than standalone tasks.

## `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`

- release-build or staging-build proof that mocks are disabled and secrets are not bundled
- secret-management proof: `SECRETS.md` coverage, Doppler/provider setup, `doppler run --` or approved command wrapper, CI/deploy injection, secret scan, and public-bundle check
- remaining blockers and founder-only gates

Acceptance:
- Unit tests alone are not enough.
- A reviewer can trace a user action from frontend/device to backend/provider state.
- Blocked E2E flows are explicit and do not get flattened into "done."

- core product loop
- aha moment and onboarding sequence
- monetization and paywall posture
- viral/referral loops
- feature surfaces
- tech architecture
- metrics
- roadmap
- risks and open questions
- evidence appendix

Acceptance:
- The spec explains why the app can win, not just what it does.
- The spec names the magical moment and V1 scalable slice before engineering planning.
- The category strategy uses store data, not internal language.
- The moat is stated as a bundle of advantages, not one vague differentiator.

- Brand choices map back to research/product evidence instead of generic taste.
- Any use of a creator/expert/framework name is constrained by permission status.

## `DESIGN.md`

Use this as the canonical design-system source of truth, following the Google Labs `design.md` format: YAML front matter for machine-readable tokens plus Markdown prose for rationale and application rules.

Must include:
- `name`, description, color tokens, typography tokens, radius tokens, spacing tokens, and component tokens where supported by the spec

- export or implementation notes for the target app stack: CSS variables, Tailwind theme, SwiftUI tokens, React Native theme, Flutter theme, or Rork/builder prompt rules

Acceptance:
- `npx @google/design.md lint DESIGN.md` passes when the CLI is available, or validation is marked blocked with the exact error.
- Tokens are specific enough for a builder to implement without inventing fonts, colors, spacing, or components.
- Any existing `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` defers to `DESIGN.md` for token truth.

## `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`

Acceptance:
- New screens can be built from tokens and components only.
- Design drift can be called a bug with a file reference.

## `design.md`

Use this as the builder-facing screen implementation spec. It should reference `DESIGN.md` for tokens and visual rules rather than redefining them.

Must include:
- product surfaces
- 11-star experience slice and trace IDs for the magical moment
- screen-by-screen flows
- trace IDs from `LAUNCH_TRACE.md` for key screens, copy claims, onboarding questions, paywall decisions, data collection, and screenshot concepts
- component contracts

- The builder can tell why each screen exists and which product/research decision it implements.
- The design spec references `ANALYTICS.md` for event names.
- The design spec references `DESIGN.md` for token names and component rules.

## `design.html`

Use this as the human-visible proof that the design system works in real layout. Every visual artifact created by this skill should be represented in HTML, even if it also uses generated images or exported screenshots.

Must include:
- CSS variables or theme definitions derived from `DESIGN.md`
- token swatches, typography specimens, spacing/radius/motion examples, and component states
- mobile-first screen frames for onboarding, aha moment, core loop, paywall/revenue surface when relevant, settings/account, empty/loading/error states, and share/referral surfaces when relevant

- ASO screenshot-frame concepts when store creative is in scope
- labels that mark assets as `direction`, `draft`, or `production`
- local preview instructions and browser/mobile visual QA notes

Acceptance:
- The file can be opened or served locally and visually inspected.
- Mobile and desktop layouts do not overlap, clip critical text, or rely on invisible/remote-only assets.
- Visual concepts, generated images, brand books, screenshot frames, and UI explorations are not left as prose-only artifacts.

## `ONBOARDING.md`

- hard/soft paywall decision, paywall placement, RevenueCat offering/experiment, restore path, and product package matrix
- closing-offer or reverse-trial behavior after paywall dismissal, if used
- first-session activation task and Day 0 cancellation prevention notes

Acceptance:
- Every onboarding question has a reason beyond "engagement".
- Self-reported attribution is visible early in the rendered flow and passes the analytics/backend data contract; it is not just a local UI choice.
- App Review popup behavior is native-platform compliant, not incentivized, and placed immediately after first value before paywall or activation detours.
- Paywall, pricing, trial, and closing offer match `REVENUE_OPS.md`, `TERMS.md`, store products, and analytics events.

## `onboarding.html`

Use this as the visual proof for onboarding and paywall flow. It can be a standalone file or a section inside `design.html` for small launches.

- legal/store/brand guardrails: partner disclosure, unsupported claims, app-store consistency, privacy/terms constraints

Acceptance:
- The channel is marked fit, blocked, deferred, or not a fit before spend starts.
- Creator operations are not confused with influencer marketing.
- The program can run without inventing contracts, payment rules, scripts, or tracking from scratch.

## `LAUNCHBENCH.md` And `FAILURE_CARDS.md`

Use when the launch is complex, the skill has been updated, or a repeated miss needs to become a reusable guardrail.

`LAUNCHBENCH.md` must include:
- scenarios run, date, runner, app repo/path, and skill version/commit if known
- deterministic validators run and command output summary
- scenario prompts or pointers to `evals/launchbench/*.yaml`
- expected failures caught and unexpected misses

Each build prompt must include:
- what to read first
- files/components to create
- implementation constraints
- analytics events required
- definition of done
- explicit scope exclusions

Acceptance:
- Prompts are ordered; later prompts can assume earlier outputs.

- expected finding format
- "do not" section to prevent generic recommendations

Acceptance:
- Another frontier model can produce prioritized findings without a briefing call.
- The prompt includes live validation URLs for robots, sitemap, llms, schema, cards, and Lighthouse when applicable.
