# {{APP_NAME}} Emotional Design Audit

Use this when you need a systematic record of the emotional quality of each user journey — onboarding, core loop, paywall, return sessions, failure states — against the four required Experience Cards and the Six-Lens Design Review Framework. Complete this artifact before marking any journey "build-ready" or "launch-ready." Discoveries map back to `eleven-star-experience.md` (star level), `analytics-attribution.md` (missing events), `failure-cards.md` (open cards), and `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md` (compliance evidence).

Load before this audit:
- `references/emotional-experience-design.md` — Six-Lens Framework, four required cards, bright-line checklist
- `references/emotional-experience-measurement.md` — per-card PostHog event catalog
- `references/eleven-star-experience.md` — star ladder and UX audit output contract
- `references/analytics-attribution.md` — master event catalog; do not invent event names outside it
- `references/onboarding-conversion.md` — paywall timing and card sequencing rules
- `references/design-room.md` and `references/design-visual-system.md` — motion tokens and `prefers-reduced-motion` requirements

## Audit Scope

### Journey Discovery Step

Do this BEFORE scoring — the ten rows below are a floor, not the scope. "Test every feature/user journey" means every reachable surface, not just the default flows.

1. `mcp__mobai__list_devices` → note the device UUID → `start_bridge` if no bridge is active → `mcp__mobai__list_apps`.
2. Cold-start the app and walk it breadth-first: open every tab, every settings row, every empty state, every locked/upsell surface, every failure path you can trigger (airplane mode, bad input, forced logout).
3. Group the reachable screens into journeys by user intent (e.g. referral redemption, in-app event, social share, widget tap, account recovery, AI-delegation flow). Add a row per app-specific journey to the table below.
4. Confirm every journey has at least one row before you begin per-journey scoring. A journey left at "Pending" with no walk is an incomplete audit, not a pass.

List every journey audited. A journey is a named, end-to-end user flow that begins with a user intent and ends with a behavioral outcome. Walk each journey on a real device via MobAI. Capture at least one screenshot per screen transition.

| Journey ID | Journey Name | Entry Point | Exit Condition | Priority | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| J-01 | First-Launch Onboarding | App cold-start | Paywall dismissed or trial started | Critical | Pending |
| J-02 | Plan / Result Generation | Core-loop trigger | Result reveal screen | Critical | Pending |
| J-03 | First Core-Loop Completion | First user action inside app | Session-close state | Critical | Pending |
| J-04 | Paywall (Direct) | Paywall shown mid-session | Purchase completed, trial started, or dismissed | Critical | Pending |
| J-05 | Return Session (Day 1–3) | Re-open after first session | Core action or drop | High | Pending |
| J-06 | Streak / Progress Surface | Home/dashboard view | User continues or closes | High | Pending |
| J-07 | Lapse Re-Engagement | Push or in-app after N-day gap | Core action or drop | High | Pending |
| J-08 | Failure / Error Recovery | Network error, payment failure, crash | User resumes or exits | Medium | Pending |
| J-09 | Subscription Management | Settings > Billing or cancel intent | User manages or exits | Medium | Pending |
| J-10 | Milestone / Level-Up Moment | Threshold crossed | User continues or shares | Medium | Pending |

Add or remove rows. Every journey must map to at least one step in the Per-Journey Audit Table below.

## Scoring Rubric

### Per-Step Score (0–10)

Each step in a journey receives a score from 0 to 10. The score is composed of two parts: a Six-Lens sub-score (0–12) converted to a 0–10 base, then adjusted by card coverage.

**Step 1: Six-Lens Sub-Score (0–12)**

Run all six lenses against the step on a real device. Sum the sub-scores.

| Lens | Question | Evidence Required | Sub-Score |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| L1 Human Goal / JTBD | Does this step clearly advance the user's named goal, not the product's data model? | Narration test on device: does it sound like "I am one step closer to my goal" or "I am filling a form"? | 0 / 1 / 2 |
| L2 Emotional Goal | Does the screen deliver the target emotional state named before design? | Screenshot + one-word target state + delivery rating. Check copy tone, visual weight, color, motion direction. | 0 / 1 / 2 |
| L3 Emotional Journey | Does the step's position on the emotional arc contribute to a rising curve that peaks before the paywall? | Emotional Journey table completed; valence score assigned; peak placement verified. | 0 / 1 / 2 |
| L4 Behavioral Analysis (Fogg B=MAP) | Does the prompt fire at a high-motivation / high-ability / low-friction moment? | Rate Motivation (1–5), Ability (1–5), Friction (decision count, copy density, cognitive load). Flag if decision count > 2. | 0 / 1 / 2 |
| L5 Experience Quality (Norman) | Does the screen deliver all three tiers — visceral, behavioral, reflective — consistent with 7-star aspiration? | 500ms first-impression check; tap every interactive element; "Would the user show this to a friend?" test. | 0 / 1 / 2 |
| L6 Service Design | Are failure states graceful, recovery paths clear, and cross-platform touchpoints (push, email, widget) consistent with in-app voice? | Test failure path on device (network down, unexpected input, session restart). Check push/email copy for brand voice match. | 0 / 1 / 2 |

**Step 2: Convert to 0–10 Base**

Divide lens total by 12, multiply by 10, round to one decimal.

`base_score = (lens_total / 12) × 10`

**Step 3: Card Coverage Adjustment (±1.0 max)**

For each Experience Card that is present and correctly triggered at this step, add +0.25. For each card that is missing but clearly applicable, subtract −0.25. Cap the total adjustment at +1.0 / −1.0.

`step_score = clamp(base_score + card_adjustment, 0, 10)`

**Score Bands — What Each Band Means**

| Score | Band | Meaning | Required Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0.0 – 3.0 | Broken | The step actively harms the emotional journey or fails multiple lenses. | Redesign before build handoff. Open a `high` or `critical` failure card. |
| 3.1 – 5.9 | Functional | The step works but delivers no emotional value. Users tolerate it. | Identify one lens to improve. Target 6+ before build handoff. |
| 6.0 – 7.9 | Competent | The step advances the goal and creates mild positive emotion. Meets 6-star. | Add at least one card or lens improvement to reach 8+. |
| 8.0 – 8.9 | Elevated | Clear emotional intent, one card implemented, rising arc contribution. Meets 7-star. | Verify card events fire. Record in PRODUCTION_READINESS.md. |
| 9.0 – 10.0 | Exceptional | All cards applicable to this step are present, measured, and on-brand. | Ship with evidence. Record bright-line compliance. |

**Per-Journey Score**

Average the step scores for all steps in the journey. A journey scoring ≥ 7.5 average with no step below 4.0 is journey-ready. A journey with any step below 4.0 requires a remediation plan regardless of average.

**Per-App Score**

Average the per-journey scores across all audited journeys, weighted by journey priority (Critical × 3, High × 2, Medium × 1). A per-app score ≥ 7.0 (weighted) with no Critical journey below 6.5 is the minimum threshold for a launch-ready emotional design claim.

**Score vs Star Ladder Cross-Reference**

| Step Score | Star Level | Star Label |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0.0 – 2.0 | 1–2 | Failure / Friction |
| 3.0 – 4.9 | 3–4 | Below expected |
| 5.0 – 6.9 | 5–6 | Expected / Better than expected |
| 7.0 – 7.9 | 6–7 | Way beyond ("made for me") |
| 8.0 – 10.0 | 7 | Way beyond (peak step) |

A single step caps at **7-star**. The 10/11-star concierge / absurd-extreme designations describe the whole-product experience in `11_STAR_EXPERIENCE.md`, never an individual screen — do not record a step as 10/11-star.

## Six-Lens Review Summary

Roll up the per-step Six-Lens scores into one app-level read. The per-journey tables below carry the detail; this is the founder-facing summary.

| Lens | App-Level Read | Weakest Journey | Strongest Journey | Lift Priority |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| L1 Human Goal / JTBD | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending |
| L2 Emotional Goal | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending |
| L3 Emotional Journey (curve) | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending |
| L4 Behavioral (Fogg B=MAP) | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending |
| L5 Experience Quality (Norman) | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending |
| L6 Service Design | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending |

## Card Application Inventory

Where each of the four named Experience Cards is currently present, missing, or misused across the audited journeys. This is the bridge from audit findings to the Card Application Map in `EMOTIONAL_DESIGN.md`. Add rows for any additional deck cards (Endowed Progress, Peak-End, Streak, etc.) that the app uses or should use.

| Experience Card | Present At | Missing / Misused At | Star Level Affected | Dark-Pattern Flag | Pathway Priority |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Commitment Card | Pending | Pending | 6 | Pending | Pending |
| Variable Reward Card | Pending | Pending | 6 | Pending | Pending |
| Perceived Effort Delay Card | Pending | Pending | 6 | Pending | Pending |
| Intent Mirroring Card | Pending | Pending | 7 | Pending | Pending |

**How to fill "Pathway to Better State" (every per-journey table and opportunity row):** a pathway entry is not a one-liner. Each must name (1) which card to apply first and which lens failure it fixes, (2) the trigger moment (screen name + user state), (3) a one-sentence copy or interaction sketch in the user's own goal language, (4) the PostHog event that measures the improvement, (5) the artifact to update (`EMOTIONAL_DESIGN.md` / `ANALYTICS.md` / `TECH_SPEC.md`), and (6) the expected star-level gain. A pathway that does not name a card and an event is incomplete.

---

## Counter-Metric Summary

For every HIGH-risk card the app applies (Variable Reward, Streak, Scarcity, Urgency, Social Proof), record the dark-pattern backfire signal being watched. A HIGH-risk card with no counter-metric in production is a blocking finding, not a polish item — mirror it to `lanes.emotional_design.blockers`.

| Card | Counter-Metric (PostHog) | Threshold To Investigate | Currently Monitored? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Variable Reward Card | `variable_reward_opt_out` rate; sub-500ms reveal dismissal; reviews mentioning "addictive"/"slot machine" | >15% opt-out; >25% fast-dismiss; any 3+ reviews | Pending |
| Streak (if applied) | streak-break churn; `notification_disabled` 48h cohort | any churn spike on break | Pending |
| Perceived Effort Delay | `effort_delay_cancelled`; reviews mentioning "fake"/"just a spinner" | >10% cancel; any 3+ reviews | Pending |
| Intent Mirroring | `subscription_cancelled` within 24h of `intent_mirror_shown` on a cancel surface | any spike | Pending |

## Emotional Curve

One curve per journey. Each curve must be rendered in `design.html` using design tokens from `DESIGN.md` (CSS variables). The static table below is the data source. Transfer it to a line chart in `design.html`.

**Acceptance Rule:** The curve must cross +2 (emotional value threshold) at or before the paywall marker step. Any journey where the first +2 crossing occurs after the paywall is a conversion design failure. Open an `emotional-curve-missing` or `emotional-curve-peak-after-paywall` failure card.

**Reduced-Motion Rule:** If the `design.html` curve uses animation to draw the line, a `prefers-reduced-motion` check must render a static chart instead.

### Emotional Curve Data Table — J-01: First-Launch Onboarding

| Step ID | Screen Label | Valence (−5 to +5) | Marker |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Splash / Value Promise | Pending | — |
| 2 | Attribution Question | Pending | — |
| 3 | Goal / Commitment Question | Pending | — |
| 4 | Personalization Q2–Q4 | Pending | — |
| 5 | Processing Screen | Pending | — |
| 6 | Plan Reveal | Pending | peak |
| 7 | Intent Mirror | Pending | — |
| 8 | Paywall | Pending | paywall |

**Paywall marker step:** Step 8. Peak must be at or before Step 8.

Repeat this table for each journey. Label one step `paywall` if applicable. Label the highest-valence step `peak`. Label the lowest-valence step `valley` if it is negative.

---

## Top Opportunities Matrix

List the highest-leverage improvements across all journeys. Rank by combined emotional impact and business impact.

| Priority | Journey | Step | Opportunity | Card to Apply | Emotional Impact | Business Impact | Effort | Star Level Gain |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending |
| 2 | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending |
| 3 | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending |
| 4 | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending |
| 5 | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending |

**How to complete this table:**
- Identify steps scoring below 6.0 in the Per-Journey table.
- For each, identify which card from `emotional-experience-design.md` addresses the root lens failure.
- Rate Emotional Impact (High / Medium / Low) using the lens sub-scores: a +2 swing on L2 or L3 is High.
- Rate Business Impact by mapping to funnel metrics: onboarding completion → trial start → D1 return → D7 return.
- Rate Effort as Small (< 1 day), Medium (1–3 days), Large (3+ days).

## Dark-Pattern Findings

Record every instance where an Experience Card trigger crosses or approaches the bright line defined in `emotional-experience-design.md §Bright Line`. Every critical finding opens a failure card of type `experience-card-dark-pattern` with severity `critical`.

| Finding ID | Journey | Step | Card Involved | Observation | Bright-Line Crossed? | Compliance Veto? | Failure Card ID | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DP-01 | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending |

**Bright-Line Checklist Per Finding**

Answer all six for every finding. All must be Yes to pass. Any No is a dark-pattern failure.

- [ ] The user can always choose to leave, cancel, or skip without a penalty or guilt-laden interstitial.
- [ ] The commitment is editable by the user at any time from a settings or profile screen.
- [ ] The variable reward variation is real content variation, not cosmetic (label or animation change only).
- [ ] The perceived effort steps correspond to real computational operations (≥50% mapping in `TECH_SPEC.md`).
- [ ] The intent mirror uses only fields the user explicitly provided — no inferred or manufactured emotional states.
- [ ] None of the four required card triggers are coupled to a paywall CTA on the same screen.

## Acceptance Checklist

Before marking this audit complete and the emotional design lane ready:

- [ ] All journeys in the Audit Scope have been walked on a real device via MobAI with screenshots attached.
- [ ] Every step in every Critical journey has a completed score in the Per-Journey table.
- [ ] No Critical journey has a step below 4.0 without an open failure card.
- [ ] Emotional Curve data tables are filled for all Critical journeys. Curves are rendered in `design.html`.
- [ ] All Emotional Curves for Critical journeys peak at or before the paywall marker.
- [ ] All Dark-Pattern Findings have an answer for each of the six bright-line checklist items.
- [ ] No dark-pattern finding has a "Compliance Veto? Yes" item without an open `critical` failure card.
- [ ] All required PostHog events for all implemented cards are confirmed in the PostHog activity view.
- [ ] All missing events have an `experience-card-event-missing` failure card open in `PROJECT_STATE.yaml`.
- [ ] All open failure cards from this audit are mirrored in `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` under the `experience` lane blockers.
- [ ] Top Opportunities matrix is complete with at least 3 prioritized rows.
- [ ] Prioritized Pathway Phase 1 (compliance) is complete or has an open failure card blocking launch.
- [ ] `npm run check:emotional-design -- --root .` passes or its failures are accounted for in open failure cards.
- [ ] Star-ladder level for each Critical journey is recorded in `11_STAR_EXPERIENCE.md` (journey audit findings section).

## Device Walk Protocol (MobAI Operationalization)

Use this protocol to walk each journey on a real device and collect per-screen evidence. Follow the MobAI guidance in `references/mobai-toolbelt.md` before starting. Do not pre-choreograph multi-step blocks without a clean dry-run.

### Pre-Walk Setup

1. Confirm MobAI bridge is active: `mcp__mobai__list_devices` → identify target device UUID.
2. Confirm app is installed and at a clean state (fresh install or cleared app data for onboarding journeys).
3. Start bridge if absent: `mcp__mobai__start_bridge`.
4. For onboarding journeys: uninstall and reinstall to guarantee a cold-start state.

### Per-Screen Evidence Protocol

For each screen transition during a journey walk:

1. Take a screenshot: `mcp__mobai__get_screenshot` → attach to the relevant step row.
2. Record the screen label and current state.
3. Assign emotional valence (−5 to +5) based on what a first-time user would likely feel at this moment.
4. Narrate the step from the user's perspective (Lens 1 test): write one sentence starting with "I am..."
5. Note any friction: tap targets too small, copy confusing, loading state absent, error state missing, decisions on screen > 2.
6. Note motion: is there an animation? Does it use the correct token? Is there a `prefers-reduced-motion` fallback?
7. Check card signals: does the screen reference the user's stated goal or commitment? Does a result reveal have an anticipation window?

### Journey-Specific Walk Instructions

**J-01 (Onboarding):** Walk from cold-start. Do not skip any screen. At the commitment question (Step 3), enter a specific, non-generic value (e.g. a real goal, not "test"). Verify it appears verbatim on the plan reveal screen (Step 6). At the intent mirror (Step 7), confirm the screen CTA is goal-aligned, not purchase-oriented. At the paywall (Step 8), confirm no Experience Card is triggering on the paywall screen itself.

**J-02 (Plan / Result Generation):** Trigger the core action. Time the anticipation window from action tap to result reveal. If the window is > 3s, check that a Skip or Cancel affordance exists. Verify `reward_variant` is not always the same value by triggering the flow twice on the same device.

**J-03 (First Core-Loop Completion):** Complete the first intended action end-to-end. Verify the session-close state includes a personalized completion signal, not a generic "Done" button.

**J-04 (Paywall):** Force the paywall to appear. Verify all three pricing tiers (if applicable) are visible. Check restore purchases is reachable within two taps. Confirm the paywall does not contain an Experience Card trigger (no commitment echo, no intent mirror, no perceived effort delay, no variable reward reveal on the paywall screen).

**J-05 (Return Session):** Kill the app. Re-open after a simulated D1 gap (or trigger via push notification). Verify the home screen references the user's commitment. Check push copy in the notification for the user's stated goal (not generic app copy).

**J-06 (Streak Surface):** Navigate to the streak or progress surface. Verify the streak counter is on the primary screen, not buried in profile. Confirm streak at-risk state is distinguishable from healthy state. If a milestone fires, verify it is a designed peak moment, not a toast.

**J-07 (Lapse Re-Engagement):** Simulate a lapse (disable push, wait or adjust device clock). Trigger the re-engagement flow. Verify the first screen contains no gap-duration shaming and no paywall. Confirm the fresh-start CTA leads directly to a core action, not a settings form.

**J-08 (Error Recovery):** Force a network error (airplane mode). Verify the error screen is in the product's voice. Verify a single clear CTA routes to the next recoverable action. If a restorative gesture fires, confirm it is unconditional (not gated on a purchase).

**J-09 (Subscription Management):** Navigate to billing settings. Find the cancel path. Verify no Experience Card trigger fires on the cancel-intent screen or the cancel-confirmation screen. Confirm no Intent Mirror, Fresh Start, or Commitment Echo is used as a cancel-flow retention mechanic (this is a compliance veto).

**J-10 (Milestone / Level-Up):** Trigger a milestone (may require manipulating data or using a test account at threshold). Verify the level-up fires as a full-screen or sheet moment, not a toast. Confirm no paywall CTA appears on the same screen as the level-up reveal.
