# Localization Market Research

Research-first localization for this app. **Demand → Prioritize → Localize → Measure.** We do not translate into every language and hope for downloads; we research search demand per market, rank markets into priority tiers, and localize only what clears the bar — then refresh from first-party analytics after launch.

See [`references/localization-market-research.md`](../../references/localization-market-research.md) for the full method. Produce this in the research phase, before any metadata, keyword field, screenshot, or paywall copy locks.

Status: partial — replace the example rows with researched markets for this app and record the data basis for each cell.

## Tool Sourcing (No TryAstro Dependency)

Compose the per-market signal from the tools this skill already routes to; cite the source and basis (estimate vs first-party) per cell. Route through `paid-tool-routing.md` before any free fallback.

| Signal | Tool used here | Basis |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Keyword popularity by storefront | AppKittie keyword popularity/traffic by country; Apple Search Ads popularity per storefront | estimate / first-party |
| Keyword difficulty | AppKittie `batch_keyword_difficulty` / `get_keyword_difficulty` | estimate |
| Market size (downloads/revenue) | AppKittie downloads/revenue estimates by country | estimate |
| Real demand in live markets | App Store Connect App Analytics / Google Play statistics by territory | first-party |
| In-language user vocabulary | XPOZ social-language research (Reddit/TikTok/X/Instagram) per locale | qualitative |

## Market Opportunity Matrix

One row per candidate country/storefront. Keywords are the **native** terms users actually search — not literal translations of the English keyword set. Every populated row cites a tool source for popularity and difficulty.

| Country / storefront | Top keywords (native) | Popularity | Difficulty | Est. demand / revenue | In-market language notes | Tool source | Priority tier |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| US (en-US) | example primary keyword, secondary keyword | 45 | 38 | high | reference market | AppKittie + Apple Search Ads | Tier 1 |
| Japan (ja) | （ネイティブ検索語） | 32 | 18 | medium-high | adapt paywall layout + plan anchoring; cultural QA required | AppKittie + XPOZ | Tier 1 |
| Brazil (pt-BR) | termo de busca nativo | 28 | 15 | medium | anchor yearly to monthly equivalent | AppKittie | Tier 2 |
| Germany (de-DE) | natives suchwort | 22 | 41 | low-medium | high difficulty — metadata-only bet | AppKittie | Tier 2 |
| France (fr-FR) | mot-clé natif | 12 | 47 | low | no demand evidence yet | AppKittie | Tier 3 |

### Rejected / deferred markets (record the reason)

| Market | Reason deferred | Revisit signal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| France (fr-FR) | keyword popularity below threshold and difficulty unwinnable now | App Analytics shows organic downloads from FR storefront |

## Priority Tiers Drive Effort

Effort scales with opportunity, not with the number of languages available.

- **Tier 1 — full localize:** metadata + keyword field + screenshots + App Preview + paywall/offer adaptation + landing + lifecycle email + optional market custom product page. Adapt paywall layout, plan anchoring, and offers — not word-for-word translation (see [`references/revenue-monetization.md`](../../references/revenue-monetization.md)).
- **Tier 2 — metadata-only:** localized title/subtitle/keyword field/description; English (or nearest Tier 1) screenshots, recorded here as an intentional gap.
- **Tier 3 — defer / track:** no localization yet; revisit from real App Analytics in the post-launch refresh.

Do not localize a surface into a market with no Tier 1/2 entry. Do not ship translated keywords with English-only screenshots unless this matrix records it as an intentional Tier 2 decision.

## Cross-Surface Rollout (Mobile And App)

Each market's tier cascades via [`references/change-cascade.md`](../../references/change-cascade.md):

| Surface | Tier 1 markets | Tier 2 markets | Owner artifact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| App Store / Play metadata + keywords | localize | localize | APP_STORE_LISTING.md |
| Screenshots + App Preview | localize | English/nearest, documented | SCREENSHOTS.md |
| Custom product pages / In-App Events | optional per market | no | APP_STORE_LISTING.md |
| Paywall / RevenueCat offers + anchoring | adapt | no | REVENUE_OPS.md |
| Landing / web (`hreflang`, `llms.txt`, schema) | localize | no | geo-seo route |
| Lifecycle email | localize | no | EMAIL_OPS.md |
| Paid UA / Apple Search Ads storefronts | from this matrix | from this matrix | growth/PAID_UA.md |

## Traceability

| Trace ID | Market decision | Evidence source | Tier | Surfaces affected |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LOC-001 | Japan is a full-localize market | AppKittie popularity 32 / difficulty 18; XPOZ in-language demand | Tier 1 | metadata, screenshots, paywall, landing |

Map each Tier 1/2 decision into `LAUNCH_TRACE.md`.

## Post-Launch Refresh

Refresh this matrix from first-party App Store Connect App Analytics / Google Play statistics on the post-launch ASO cadence (`aso-store-ops.md` §10): promote Tier 2/3 markets that are downloading/converting, prune localized markets that under-deliver. This is a living artifact.

## Founder-Only Gates

Paid AppKittie/XPOZ provisioning, translation/cultural-QA spend, and any market launch decision are founder gates. Prepare the matrix and rollout plan; do not commit spend or submit localized listings without approval.
