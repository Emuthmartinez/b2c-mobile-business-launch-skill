Canonical screenshot packet: `SCREENSHOTS.md`

| Slot | ASC device_type | Device well | Required/scaled decision | Screenshot count | Version localization ID | Locale | Headline | Source screen | Supporting asset | Tool | Size/alpha validation | Final path | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Rules:
- Real app UI capture is the proof layer; raw screenshots are not final upload assets.
- Prefer ParthJadhav/app-store-screenshots for local production composition and bulk export when screenshot decks need copy-led iPhone/iPad/Play variants; save `app-store-screenshots.json` or the equivalent board state when used.
- Final upload candidates need production composition: headline, copy overlay, device frame or intentional frameless treatment, export target, and visual QA.
- Use current `asc screenshots sizes --all` before choosing device types; do not rely on stale dimension tables.
- Final upload candidates need alpha transparency removed, color-space checked, size validated, and associated with the correct version localization ID.
- Higgsfield may create supporting visuals, icons, backgrounds, mascots, CPP/event media, or thumbnails only when tied to `DESIGN.md`.
- Store screenshots and previews should express the V1 scalable slice from `11_STAR_EXPERIENCE.md` without crossing the line of feasibility.
- Remotion may render screenshot frames, app previews, captioned demo clips, CPP/event variants, or social/store cuts from real UI only after `CONTENT_ASSETS.md` records route approval, license status, source inputs, render proof, and output paths.
- Generated or rendered visuals must not imply unsupported features, claims, prices, or endorsements.
