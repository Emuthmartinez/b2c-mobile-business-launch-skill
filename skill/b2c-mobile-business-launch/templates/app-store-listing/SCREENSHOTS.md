# {{APP_NAME}} Store Screenshots Packet

Docs refreshed: Pending
Status: partial
Owner: design-guru + marketing-guru + orchestrator

Raw device captures prove the product exists. Final store screenshots are composed marketing assets that combine real app UI, copy, device framing, current device wells, and visual QA.

## Asset Knowledge Brief

Store assets are not generic marketing — they are engineered from everything the launch already knows. Fill this brief before composing any screenshot or app preview, then feed it to the screenshot ASO skill and the `app-preview-video` skill. Generic, knowledge-free assets are a launch miss and an audit finding.

| Knowledge source | What it feeds into the assets |
| --- | --- |
| `RESEARCH.md` | target user, the problem in their own pain language, top objections to answer, competitor visual conventions to break from |
| `11_STAR_EXPERIENCE.md` | the one magical V1 moment — this is the hook payoff and Screenshot 1 |
| `EMOTIONAL_DESIGN.md` + `references/experience-cards.md` | the Emotional North Star (the feeling the 5-second hook must create), the target emotional curve, and which Experience Card the hook instantiates |
| `DESIGN.md` + `BRAND.md` | tokens, type, color, motion, and voice so every asset is design-aligned |
| `APP_STORE_LISTING.md` | keyword/positioning alignment so captions reinforce the metadata |

### Per-Slot Knowledge Map

| Slot | Knowledge drawn on | Emotion / Experience Card targeted | Headline | Truthfulness check |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hook video — first frame + first 3–5s | 11-star magical moment + Emotional North Star | the hook's target feeling + card (e.g. Intent Mirroring "made for me", Variable Reward "look what you get") | Pending | shows real app; matches what the app does |
| Screenshot 1 | magical moment + main outcome | primary emotional beat | Pending | no unsupported outcome claim |
| Screenshot 2 | differentiated proof / core loop | competence, trust | Pending | real UI |
| Screenshot 3 | conversion/result + objection answered | confidence, momentum | Pending | pricing matches `REVENUE_OPS.md` |
| Screenshot 4–5 | secondary benefit / breadth / trust | belonging, relief | Pending | one idea; no fake ratings/endorsement |

## Composition And Export Route

Preferred local route: ParthJadhav/app-store-screenshots.

Inputs:
- real app captures from `screenshots/raw/`
- `app-icon/app-icon-1024.png`
- `DESIGN.md`, `design.md`, and `11_STAR_EXPERIENCE.md`
- headline/copy story from `APP_STORE_LISTING.md`
- Higgsfield supporting art only when recorded in `CONTENT_ASSETS.md`

Outputs:
- screenshot editor or board: `screenshots/index.html` or generated app-store-screenshots workspace
- reusable deck state: `app-store-screenshots.json` when the external skill is used
- final no-alpha PNGs under `screenshots/final/<locale>/<device-well>/`
- ASC validation output and `asc-shots-pipeline` upload dry-run output in `STORE_CONSOLE.md`

## Device Wells

Run current sizing before export. Record ready, blocked, or not needed for each target.

| Platform | Well | Required/scaled decision | ASC device_type | Screenshot count | Current Apple size basis | Target file | Validation proof | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## App Icon

| Asset | Source | Route | Output | QA | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1024x1024 App Icon | `DESIGN.md` + competitor icon context | Higgsfield or designer/founder-owned asset | `app-icon/app-icon-1024.png` | no alpha, no rounded corners, thumbnail test, category differentiation | blocked |

## App Preview Video (Autoplay Hook)

The app preview video is the most underused growth lever on the App Store. Treat it as a **required** asset for any iOS launch (mark `deferred` only with a founder-approved reason). Verified Apple behavior (refresh against the App Store sources in `references/source-registry.yaml` before upload):

- You can upload **up to 3 app previews** per device size and language, and **app previews always precede screenshots** at the top of the product page.
- On the product page, **app previews autoplay with muted audio** — Apple's own guidance: "make sure the first few seconds of your video are visually compelling." The first preview is a hook the user watches whether they intended to or not.
- Length is **up to 30 seconds** (Apple's accepted range is 15–30s; confirm the current min/max in the app preview specifications before render). The **poster frame** displays whenever the video does not autoplay, so it must sell on its own.
- Source MUST be real in-app footage (captured via MobAI, Codex Desktop native iOS/XcodeBuildMCP, serve-sim, or on-device), never generated UI. SnapshotPreviews can support preview/component regression evidence but does not replace runtime App Preview footage.

### The 5-Second Muted Hook (required spec)

Because the first preview plays silent and unrequested, its first ~3–5 seconds must:

- Communicate the core value with **no audio dependency** — on-screen text/captions carry the message.
- **Show the payoff first** — the magical V1 moment from `11_STAR_EXPERIENCE.md` — not a logo, splash, or slow intro.
- Land the **Emotional North Star** feeling instantly and instantiate the hook's Experience Card from the Asset Knowledge Brief (`EMOTIONAL_DESIGN.md` + `references/experience-cards.md`).
- Read at a glance with motion that is legible muted.
- Have a **poster frame** that already sells if autoplay is blocked.
- Be **truthful** — the hook must match what the app actually does; no bait-and-switch, fake UI, or oversold outcome.

### Production Route (mandatory)

Both screenshots and the app preview run through the screenshot ASO skill; they are never hand-composed one-offs:

- **Screenshots:** `ParthJadhav/app-store-screenshots` (the screenshot ASO skill), `ios-screenshots`, and `aso-skills:screenshot-optimization`, from real UI, App Icon, and design tokens.
- **App preview:** script/storyboard via `aso-skills:app-preview-video`; capture real footage via MobAI, Codex Desktop native iOS/XcodeBuildMCP, or serve-sim; edit and caption via Remotion; produce all Apple/Play resolution variants (9:16 / 1:1 / 16:9) from a single master via the Higgsfield `reframe` MCP tool (Master → All Platforms recipe in `references/tool-recipes.md`) — reframe reformats aspect ratio only, never substitutes UI.
- A/B test variants with `aso-skills:ab-test-store-listing` (Product Page Optimization) where available.

| Preview | Knowledge-leveraged hook (first 3–5s) | Emotion / Card | Poster frame | Captions (muted) | Skill route | Output | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| iOS Preview 1 (autoplay hook) | magical V1 moment shown as the payoff | North Star feeling + hook card | must sell silent | required | app-preview-video → MobAI → Remotion → reframe | `previews/ios-preview-1.mp4` | blocked |
| iOS Preview 2–3 (optional) | secondary proof / breadth | secondary beat | Pending | required | same | `previews/ios-preview-2.mp4` | optional |
| Google Play promo | hook payoff, YouTube-hosted | North Star feeling | n/a | recommended | same | YouTube URL pending | optional |

Produce required resolution variants by `reframe`-ing one master rather than re-rendering per size; the source must be real app footage. See the Master → All Platforms recipe in `references/tool-recipes.md`.

## Definition of Good: Present / Proven / Optimized

This section is the machine-readable contract for `check:store-screenshots`. Each layer has a defined enforcement mode.

### PRESENT — packet filled (hard-error when lane is "partial" or "done")

The SCREENSHOTS.md packet is filled: no cell in any required matrix still reads "Pending", "Blocked", or is empty. Specifically:

- Every required row in the Raw Capture Matrix has a non-empty source screen, capture tool, raw path, and status.
- Every required row in the Production Composition Matrix has a non-empty headline, route, final upload path, and dimensions.
- Every required Device Wells row has a confirmed required/scaled/not-needed decision.
- The Narrative table has headings and copy for every required slot.
- The Per-Slot Knowledge Map is filled for every slot.

### PROVEN — objective on-disk evidence (hard-error when lane is "done")

Evidence that the work actually happened, not just that it was declared:

1. **Raw captures exist on disk** at the exact paths listed in the Raw Capture Matrix (e.g. `screenshots/raw/iphone-69-slot-1.png`). A filled path that points to a non-existent file is a hard error.
2. **`app-store-screenshots.json` exists** and is a valid schema-v2 file. Its `rawPaths` (or equivalent field) reference files that exist on disk.
3. **Final PNGs exist** under `screenshots/final/<locale>/<device-well>/` for every required device well at the correct ASC dimensions. Alpha-removed, sRGB. The validator checks existence; the dimensions/color-space proof is in the upload log.
4. **One deck per Tier-1 locale**: for every locale listed in `LOCALIZATION_MARKET_RESEARCH.md` that is marked Tier-1, a final screenshot deck exists under `screenshots/final/<locale>/`.
5. **Theme is token-derived**: `app-store-screenshots.json` must reference `state/theme.tokens.json` or contain a `tokensSource` field pointing to it. The ParthJadhav theme was generated FROM design tokens, not hand-coded colors.
6. **Captions contain keyword tokens from `APP_STORE_LISTING.md`**: at least one headline in `app-store-screenshots.json` contains a keyword that also appears in the `keywords` field of `APP_STORE_LISTING.md`. ASO fold-in is data-wired, not declared.
7. **Upload proof in `STORE_CONSOLE.md`**: the `asc-shots-pipeline` dry-run or upload output is recorded there before the lane is marked "done".

### OPTIMIZED — quality bar (warning + logged override; taste stays human)

Rubric scores are recorded in `screenshot-rubric-scores.json`. For every required slot/locale:

- Either `pass: true` (weighted-high dimensions all >= 2, overall weighted score >= threshold in `SCREENSHOT_RUBRIC.md`), OR
- A non-empty `override.reason` is logged by the founder.

A slot with no score entry at all is an error when the lane is "done" and a warning when "partial".

**Producer != Verifier (Tier 2 enforcement):** The ledger root must carry distinct non-empty `builder` and `grader` identity fields. The agent or session that built the deck may not grade it. The validator errors (when "done") or warns (when "partial") if `grader` is missing, if `grader === builder`, or if any required slot lacks non-empty `grader_notes`. See `SCREENSHOT_RUBRIC.md` for the full grader protocol.

**Suspicious perfect score:** When every high dimension is scored 3 and `grader_notes` is very short, the validator fires `store_screenshots.suspicious_perfect` warning. A perfect score needs proportionally detailed justification.

**Tier-1 anti-gaming:** `screenshot-rubric-scores.json` that is byte-identical to `screenshot-rubric-scores.example.json` or smaller than 200 bytes is rejected as an unmodified scaffold copy.

**Tier-3 PNG reality checks:** For every `final_png` in the ledger, the validator reads the real PNG IHDR bytes (width, height, bit depth, color type) and verifies that declared device-well dimensions match the file and that no alpha channel is present when `alpha removed` is claimed in the Production Composition Matrix.

### Pipeline Spine

This is the canonical end-to-end pipeline. Every step must be evidenced before the lane can be "done".

```
Capture (MobAI / ios-screenshots / XcodeBuildMCP / serve-sim)
  → real app frames at screenshots/raw/<device>/<locale>/

Compose (ParthJadhav/app-store-screenshots)
  → themed from state/theme.tokens.json          [token fold-in: data-wired]
  → copy/headlines from APP_STORE_LISTING.md keywords  [ASO fold-in: data-wired]
  → one deck per Tier-1 locale from LOCALIZATION_MARKET_RESEARCH.md
  → outputs: app-store-screenshots.json (schema v2) + screenshots/index.html

Grade (SCREENSHOT_RUBRIC.md + SEPARATE grader agent/session — never the builder)
  → builder identity recorded at ledger root "builder" field
  → grader identity recorded at ledger root "grader" field (must differ from builder)
  → per-slot grader_notes written (non-empty, explains each dimension)
  → scores written to screenshot-rubric-scores.json
  → pass or founder override logged

Resize / validate (asc-screenshot-resize)
  → final PNGs at screenshots/final/<locale>/<device-well>/
  → alpha removed, sRGB, correct ASC dimensions

Upload (asc-shots-pipeline)
  → dry-run output and upload proof in STORE_CONSOLE.md
```

## Visual QA

- [ ] An iOS app preview video exists (or a founder-approved deferral is recorded); the first preview is the autoplay hook and precedes the screenshots.
- [ ] The first 3–5 seconds communicate the core value MUTED, with on-screen text and the magical V1 moment shown first (no logo/splash intro).
- [ ] The poster frame sells on its own when autoplay is blocked.
- [ ] The hook lands the Emotional North Star feeling and instantiates its Experience Card per the Asset Knowledge Brief.
- [ ] The hook is truthful — real app footage, no fake UI or oversold outcome.
- [ ] Both screenshots and the app preview were produced via the screenshot ASO skill (`ParthJadhav/app-store-screenshots` / `ios-screenshots` / `app-preview-video`), not hand-composed one-offs.
- [ ] Every screenshot slot and the hook draw on the Asset Knowledge Brief (`RESEARCH.md` user/problem, `11_STAR_EXPERIENCE.md` magical moment, `EMOTIONAL_DESIGN.md` emotion/cards).
- [ ] Headlines are readable at App Store search thumbnail size.
- [ ] Copy overlay uses one idea per slide and matches `APP_STORE_LISTING.md`.
- [ ] Real app UI remains visible and truthful in every production composition.
- [ ] Generated Higgsfield assets are supporting visuals, not fake product proof.
- [ ] Remotion or HTML compositions record source inputs, license status, render proof, and outputs in `CONTENT_ASSETS.md`.
- [ ] ParthJadhav/app-store-screenshots deck state or equivalent export board is saved when used, including app icon, locale, iPhone/iPad deck, and final PNG paths.
- [ ] Pricing, trial, renewal, subscription, and feature claims match `REVENUE_OPS.md`, paywall copy, and legal docs.
- [ ] Alpha transparency is removed and color space is acceptable for upload.
- [ ] iPhone and iPad safe areas, text fit, overlap, and contrast are checked.
- [ ] Localized screenshot copy is reviewed for each shipped locale.
- [ ] Founder approval is recorded before screenshot upload, App Icon replacement, App Preview upload, CPP/event media submission, or paid asset generation.
- [ ] `screenshot-rubric-scores.json` exists and every required slot has either `pass: true` or a non-empty `override.reason`.
