# {{APP_NAME}} UX Patterns

This packet records Refero or founder-approved fallback UX research. It is a pattern contract, not a mood board. Do not copy one source directly; adapt observed patterns to this product's strategy, `DESIGN.md`, analytics, privacy, and implementation constraints.

## Refero Route

- Refero docs checked: Pending
- MCP/auth state: Pending
- Route selected:
  - [ ] Refero used
  - [ ] founder-provided Refero export used
  - [ ] founder-approved fallback used
  - [ ] blocked waiting for access
- Current docs basis to refresh before live use:
  - `https://doc.refero.design/llms.txt`
  - `https://doc.refero.design/mcp/getting-started`
  - `https://doc.refero.design/mcp/tools`
  - `https://doc.refero.design/mcp/data-model`
  - `https://doc.refero.design/mcp/examples`

If Refero is unavailable, stop for founder approval before using this free baseline route. Record the approval in `TOOL_DECISIONS.md`.

For Android launches, treat Refero iOS/mobile records as journey evidence, not Android-specific proof. Adapt controls, navigation, permission copy, billing, and screenshots to Android-native expectations and verify on Android before marking the Android UX lane launch-ready.

## Pattern Inventory

| Surface | Platform | User goal | Pattern choice | Required states | Analytics | Proof |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Onboarding value promise | iOS/Android/web | Understand the app promise quickly | Product demo or guided promise before questions | loading, reduced motion, no video | `onboarding_started`, `demo_video_viewed` | `onboarding.html` |
| Self-reported attribution | iOS/Android/web | Tell where they found the app | Required early source question with stable keys and `other` text | validation, other text, privacy note | `attribution_source_selected` | `ONBOARDING.md`, `ANALYTICS.md` |
| Personalized plan | iOS/Android/web | See answers reflected back | Plan summary that mirrors user input | loading, edit/back, empty answers | `personalized_plan_viewed` | `onboarding.html` |
| Paywall | iOS/Android/web | Choose whether to buy | Value-first paywall with restore, trial/renewal clarity, and close behavior | loading prices, purchase error, restore, premium active | `paywall_viewed`, `purchase_completed`, `restore_succeeded` | `REVENUE_OPS.md` |
| Closing offer | iOS/Android/web | Reconsider after dismissing | Transparent downsell/trial/shorter commitment, no fake scarcity | accepted, rejected, expired, unavailable | `closing_offer_viewed`, `closing_offer_selected` | `onboarding.html` |
| Permissions | iOS/Android/web | Understand why access is needed | Explain-before-native-prompt with skip/retry path | denied, limited, retry, settings link | `permission_prompt_viewed`, `permission_result` | `design.md` |
| Empty state | app/web | Know what to do first | One primary action plus example content | loading, empty, error, offline | `empty_state_viewed`, `empty_state_cta_clicked` | `design.html` |
| Error recovery | app/web | Recover without losing work | Plain-language error, retry, contact/support path | network, validation, payment, auth | `error_shown`, `retry_clicked` | `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md` |
| Settings/account | app/web | Manage account and subscription | Grouped settings with billing, privacy, support, delete account | auth expired, restore, destructive confirm | `settings_viewed`, `account_delete_started` | `design.md` |
| Support/contact | app/web/email | Get help with purchase/account issues | Support form/email path with SLA and context | sent, failed, reply expected | `support_started`, `support_submitted` | `EMAIL_OPS.md` |
| Referral/share | app/web | Share useful result or invite | Native share or copy link with clear value | copied, failed, unsupported | `share_started`, `share_completed` | `growth.html` |

## Flow Map

### Mobile Onboarding Playbook

Keep this sequence unless a named experiment is approved:

1. Value promise or short product demo.
2. One or more personalization questions that change the product experience.
3. Required attribution question within the first third of onboarding.
4. Personalized plan or result preview that reflects answers.
5. Review prompt only after a real delight moment and only through platform APIs.
6. Paywall after value is clear, with restore purchases and legal links.
7. Closing offer or reverse trial if monetization strategy supports it.
8. First activation task after purchase or before paywall when the model requires it.

### Web Funnel

1. Landing page states the product category, outcome, and proof.
2. CTA routes to waitlist, web purchase, or app-store preorder.
3. Form captures email, attribution, consent, and referral code where relevant.
4. Confirmation state explains next step and sends a branded Resend email.
5. If web purchase exists, Stripe/RevenueCat entitlement mapping is verified before the app claims access.

### Account, Billing, And Trust

1. Settings exposes restore purchases, subscription management, support, privacy, terms, and account deletion.
2. Billing errors explain the next action without blaming the user.
3. Destructive actions use confirmation and recovery where platform rules allow it.
4. Account deletion links match App Store and Google Play requirements.

## State Matrix

| State | UX rule | Build proof |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Loading | Preserve layout size; use skeletons or progress, not layout jumps. | UI test or screenshot |
| Empty | Explain why it is empty and offer one primary action. | `design.html` |
| Error | State what failed, whether work is safe, and how to retry/contact support. | E2E failure path |
| Offline | Show cached state where possible and a retry path. | simulator/network test |
| Permission denied | Explain consequence, alternate path, and settings route. | device test |
| Premium locked | Show value, price path, restore, and legal links. | purchase sandbox test |
| Restored purchase | Confirm access and update profile/backend entitlement. | RevenueCat/store proof |
| Destructive confirm | Use explicit object name, consequence, and cancellation path. | UI test |

## Bug Traps

- Attribution is visible but not persisted to analytics/person/backend.
- Paywall hides restore purchases or legal links.
- `Other` attribution has no free text.
- Permission prompt appears before the user understands why.
- Loading states resize buttons or cards.
- Empty states have no useful first action.
- Web purchase does not map to mobile entitlement.
- Account deletion exists in docs but not in the app/store console.
- Mobile text fits in English but clips at larger accessibility sizes.
- HTML proof uses different tokens than `DESIGN.md`.
