Creative scoring gate: score every video creative with the Virality Predictor (`brain_activity`) before paid distribution; do not spend on an unscored video creative. Record `virality_score` and `hook_dmn_risk` per creative and feed low scorers back through revision. See the Virality Closed Loop recipe in `tool-recipes.md`. (For static-only creative or a documented exception, record "virality scoring not applicable" with the reason.)
