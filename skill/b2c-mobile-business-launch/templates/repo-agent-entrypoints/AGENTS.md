# {{APP_NAME}} Agent Guide

This repo is the operating home for {{APP_NAME}}, a B2C mobile app business by {{BUSINESS_NAME}}.

Continue using the `b2c-mobile-business-launch` skill for launch, store, revenue, analytics, security, growth, and production-readiness work. Once the skill is active, do not ask the founder to re-invoke it; load the next needed skill reference, update `PROJECT_STATE.yaml`, rerender `launch-cockpit.html`, and run the relevant validators until a founder-only gate is reached.

## 60-Second Brief

- Product: {{PRODUCT_BRIEF}}
- Target user: {{TARGET_USER}}
- Business model: {{BUSINESS_MODEL}}
- Platforms: {{PLATFORMS}}
- Current phase: read `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` and `launch-cockpit.html`
- Primary repos or apps: {{SOURCE_REPO_PATHS}}

## Read First

- State and cockpit: `PROJECT_STATE.yaml`, `launch-cockpit.html`
- Design Room: `state/business.json`, `state/theme.tokens.json`, `design-room.html`
- Product and trace: `SPEC.md`, `LAUNCH_TRACE.md`, `11_STAR_EXPERIENCE.md`, `EMOTIONAL_DESIGN.md`, `BRAND.md`
- Build and operations: `TECH_SPEC.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `ANALYTICS.md`, `SECRETS.md`, `SECURITY.md`
- Orchestration and readiness: `ORCHESTRATION.md`, `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`, `APP_AGENTS.md`

If a listed file does not exist yet, create or update it through the relevant `b2c-mobile-business-launch` reference instead of inventing a one-off replacement.

## Session Continuity

- At the start of every new session, resume, status check, or handoff, reconstruct state from `AGENTS.md`, `PROJECT_STATE.yaml`, `launch-cockpit.html`, `ORCHESTRATION.md`, `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`, `FAILURE_CARDS.md`, and `git status --short` before choosing work.
- Do not rely on chat memory or prior transcripts as source truth; if they conflict with repo state, repo state wins.
- For broad work, route through `APP_AGENTS.md` and role prompts, or record why subagents are unavailable or unsafe in `ORCHESTRATION.md` and `PROJECT_STATE.yaml`.
- After material changes, update state/readiness/failure cards and rerender `launch-cockpit.html` before pausing.

## Source Of Truth

This file is a map, not a product spec. Keep durable product truth in the files below, keep active plans in `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` and `ORCHESTRATION.md`, and keep mechanical enforcement in validators, LaunchBench, and failure cards.

- State and blockers: `PROJECT_STATE.yaml`, `launch-cockpit.html`, `FAILURE_CARDS.md`, `LAUNCHBENCH.md`
- Design Room state: `state/business.json`, `state/theme.tokens.json`, `design-room.html`, and `dist/design-room/`
- Product and evidence: `RESEARCH.md`, `SPEC.md`, `LAUNCH_TRACE.md`, `11_STAR_EXPERIENCE.md`, `11-star-experience.html`, `EMOTIONAL_DESIGN.md`, `EMOTIONAL_AUDIT.md`
- Implementation: `TECH_SPEC.md`, `ENGINEERING_PLAN.md`, `ORCHESTRATION.md`, `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`
- Design and content: `BRAND.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `design.md`, `design.html`, `UX_PATTERNS.md`, `CONTENT_ASSETS.md`, `DEMO_VIDEO.md`
- Growth and stores: `LAUNCH.md`, `GEO_SEO.md`, `PAID_UA.md`, `VIRAL_GROWTH.md`, `UGC_PLAYBOOK.md`, `FASTLANE_OPS.md`, `APP_STORE_LISTING.md`, `APPLE_APP_STORE_REQUIREMENTS.md`, `SCREENSHOTS.md`, `STORE_CONSOLE.md`, `APPLE_SIGNING.md`
- Revenue, lifecycle, and trust: `REVENUE_OPS.md`, `ANALYTICS.md`, `EMAIL_OPS.md`, `PRIVACY.md`, `TERMS.md`, `SECRETS.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `security-review.html`
- Role routing: `APP_AGENTS.md` and `agents/`

## Skill Workflow

- Use `b2c-mobile-business-launch` as the default workflow for broad launch/business work, business-side setup, App Store or Google Play readiness, RevenueCat/Stripe/PostHog/Resend setup, MobAI/native iOS proof, security release work, GEO/SEO, UGC/Fastlane, and production-readiness claims.
- Keep `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` current before crossing phases, claiming a lane is done, spawning agents, changing provider state, or pausing at a blocker.
- Rerender `launch-cockpit.html` whenever state, blockers, provider status, proof, or launch-readiness changes.
- Use `references/engineering-orchestration.md`, `references/parallel-agent-orchestration.md`, and `references/app-agent-roster.md` from the skill before editing `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `APP_AGENTS.md`, `ORCHESTRATION.md`, `ENGINEERING_PLAN.md`, or `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`.
- For broad launch/build work, either use `APP_AGENTS.md` and the role prompts under `agents/` for read-only specialist audits or record why subagents are unavailable or unsafe in `ORCHESTRATION.md` and `PROJECT_STATE.yaml`. The orchestrator owns integration, state, git, releases, and final readiness.
- Runtime split (a recommendation, not a requirement): the default bias is Claude for the pre-build stages through the spec (research, social mining, 11-star/emotional design, growth, analytics, spec readiness) and Codex for the core app build. On Claude Code, prefer a Dynamic Workflow for the long-running, parallel, or adversarial pre-build stages (`ultracode` / `/effort ultracode` / `/deep-research`): budget tokens, pair loops with `/goal`, quarantine untrusted reviews/social/scraped input, keep producer and verifier agents separate. If you are on Codex (no `ultracode`/`/workflows`) and the active work is a pre-build stage, surface that recommendation once — plainly, not as a gate — record it in `PROJECT_STATE.yaml`, then continue here regardless, running the same fan-out/adversarial-verification/quarantine shapes as subagents. Record which runtime handled which lane in `ORCHESTRATION.md`; do not spend a Claude workflow on the build Codex is better at.

## Scope

V1 scope: {{V1_SCOPE}}. Future scope: {{FUTURE_SCOPE}}. Banned scope: {{BANNED_SCOPE}}.

Do not let builders or agents add product behavior that is not traced from `LAUNCH_TRACE.md`, the 11-star V1 scalable slice, or an explicit founder-approved scope change.

## Engineering

- Stack: {{STACK_SUMMARY}}
- Run commands through the repo's package manager and scripts when available. Record exact verification in `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`.
- Use Compound Engineering routes when available: `ce-update` or latest-release fallback, `ce-brainstorm` for unresolved product shape, `ce-plan` for implementation planning, `ce-work` for bounded execution, `ce-worktree` for isolated lanes, `ce-code-review`, applicable CE test skills, and `ce-proof`/`ce-demo-reel` before readiness claims. Record the route in `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` `compound_engineering`, `ORCHESTRATION.md`, `ENGINEERING_PLAN.md`, and `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`. If unavailable, record the fallback reason in `ORCHESTRATION.md` and keep the lane partial until equivalent plan/work/review/test/proof exists.
- Use `ORCHESTRATION.md` before parallel work. Parallel agents are for independent audits or isolated file ownership only; serialize shared files, migrations, provider/account mutations, device control, git, releases, pricing/legal/public posting, submissions, and final readiness.
- Backend/frontend proof must show real data, provider state, analytics events, entitlement state, email delivery, or store/signing state where those lanes are in scope.
- For iOS work in Codex Desktop, use exposed native iOS/XcodeBuildMCP tools before shelling out: call `session_show_defaults` before the first build/run/test, prefer `build_run_sim` or matching MCP tools when defaults are set, and record project/workspace, scheme, simulator/device, output paths, provider-proof pairing, and limitations in `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`.
- For CLI users, SnapshotPreviews and serve-sim are supported proof routes: SnapshotPreviews exports preview-only PNG/JSON proof via `TEST_RUNNER_SNAPSHOTS_EXPORT_DIR`; serve-sim streams a booted iOS Simulator at a URL such as `http://localhost:3200`. Neither replaces runtime provider proof or `APPLE_SIGNING.md` distribution readiness.

## Design And UX

- All design work follows STATE -> MUTATE -> VERSION -> RENDER. Mutate `state/business.json` and `state/theme.tokens.json`, render `design-room.html`, and version/baseline with git instead of creating one-off design proposal files.
- `DESIGN.md` owns tokens, voice, components, visual rules, and the tokenized `motion.*` scale.
- Motion is tokenized and platform-split. Web surfaces (landing, funnels, web paywall, Design Room preview) ship motion with framer-motion / the `motion` library reading the promoted `--motion-*` CSS variables; the mobile binary (SwiftUI/Flutter/React Native) uses native animation from `DesignTokens.Motion` and must never import framer-motion. Honor reduced motion on every surface. When the `ui-ux-pro-max` skill is installed, use it (reference-only, do not copy its data) for senior-grade web UI, design-system reasoning, and motion/anti-pattern guidance.
- The optional `state.designBrief` (seed it with `npm run seed:design-brief`, then adapt ui-ux-pro-max output) records recommended style, palette/typography mood, key effects, and anti-patterns, and renders in `design-room.html`. `check:template-safety` fails CI if framer-motion/`motion` is imported from app/template code; keep it on web surfaces only.
- HTML proofs must be opened and checked on mobile and desktop before visual work is called ready.
- Onboarding, paywall, review prompt, empty/loading/error/offline states, screenshots, and content assets must trace to the 11-star V1 scalable slice.
- When the 11-star target is 6-star or higher, `EMOTIONAL_DESIGN.md` owns the Experience Card map, ethics guardrails, PostHog events, reduced-motion fallbacks, and counter-metrics. Run `npm run check:emotional-design -- --root .` before build or store handoff, and use `EMOTIONAL_AUDIT.md` for existing-app emotional UX audits.
- `BRAND.md` owns voice, owned words, banned language, and claim boundaries; do not let copy rewrites, screenshots, app previews, lifecycle email, or support responses drift from it.
- Store screenshots need `SCREENSHOTS.md`: raw MobAI/native iOS/device captures are proof inputs, while final iPhone/iPad/Play assets need copy overlays, composed frames, ParthJadhav/app-store-screenshots or equivalent export-board routing, App Icon/App Preview routing, current device wells, validation, and visual QA.
- Demo/app-preview video work needs `DEMO_VIDEO.md`: choreography, raw capture, edited export, captions, upload copy, rerender path, and truth/accessibility QA must be recorded before public use.
- iOS App Store upload readiness needs `APPLE_APP_STORE_REQUIREMENTS.md`: `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`, required reason APIs, third-party SDK manifests/signatures, Xcode privacy report, App Privacy labels, protected-resource purpose strings, ATT, account deletion, review notes, and archive/upload warnings are checked before a build is pushed into App Store Connect.

## Store Ops

- Use `app-store-connect-cli.md` before all App Store Connect work. ASC CLI/skill routes can cover app creation, app-record inspection, metadata, screenshots, TestFlight, review/status reads, products/subscriptions, and RevenueCat catalog reconciliation.
- Do not answer that an agent cannot create the app until ASC CLI auth, account role, agreements, current `asc --help`, and the ASC skill pack have been checked. Blocked auth or unapproved sticky fields are founder gates, not manual-only defaults.

## Analytics, Revenue, And Secrets

- `ANALYTICS.md` owns event names, identity, attribution, funnels, dashboards, and QA proof.
- Attribution is a data contract: stable source keys, `other` free text when used, `attribution_source_selected`, PostHog `self_reported_source`, backend/profile persistence when identity exists, and anonymous-to-identified reconciliation.
- `PAID_UA.md` owns paid acquisition readiness: one-channel choice, creative cadence, tracking baseline, blended report, RevenueCat LTV/CPA review, stop/scale rules, and founder-only spend gates.
- `REVENUE_OPS.md` owns products, prices, entitlements, webhooks, restore/refund flows, and purchase proof.
- `SECRETS.md` owns all secret names, locations, command wrappers, CI/deploy injection, and founder-only blockers. Use Doppler by default or the approved provider. Never commit, print, screenshot, or log raw secret values.

## Security And Compliance

- `SECURITY.md` and `security-review.html` are release-lane artifacts, not optional polish.
- Security work must cover threat model, data classification, mobile platform hardening, app integrity, entitlement/webhook abuse controls, supply chain, monitoring, incident response, accepted risks, and security-tool routing.
- Public privacy, terms, pricing, subscription, endorsement, medical, legal, financial, urgency, and security claims require source truth and founder approval when policy or liability changes.

## Founder-Only Gates

Ask before credentials, account access, paid signups or spend, pricing changes, billing/subscription moves, domain purchases, DNS/MX changes, legal approval, public posting or scheduling, app-store submission, destructive actions, force pushes, production data mutations, or final release decisions.

## Common Mistakes

- Do not replace the launch skill with a generic app-build prompt.
- Do not copy maintainer instructions from the skill repo into this business repo.
- Do not treat simulator success, mocked data, local-only UI events, or prose-only plans as production proof.
- Do not let `CLAUDE.md`, `APP_AGENTS.md`, role prompts, or builder prompts duplicate product truth that belongs in this file and the source docs.
- Do not silently downgrade paid/account-gated tooling to free fallbacks; record approval or blockers in `TOOL_DECISIONS.md`.

## Verification

Run the relevant repo-local commands plus installed-skill validators. From the installed skill, use:

```bash
cd ~/.codex/skills/b2c-mobile-business-launch
npm run validate:launch-state -- --root /path/to/{{APP_SLUG}} --state PROJECT_STATE.yaml
npm run check:orchestration -- --root /path/to/{{APP_SLUG}} --state PROJECT_STATE.yaml
npm run check:secrets -- --root /path/to/{{APP_SLUG}} --state PROJECT_STATE.yaml
npm run check:security -- --root /path/to/{{APP_SLUG}} --state PROJECT_STATE.yaml
npm run check:store-screenshots -- --root /path/to/{{APP_SLUG}} --state PROJECT_STATE.yaml
npm run check:apple-signing -- --root /path/to/{{APP_SLUG}} --state PROJECT_STATE.yaml
npm run check:apple-requirements -- --root /path/to/{{APP_SLUG}} --state PROJECT_STATE.yaml
npm run check:store-console -- --root /path/to/{{APP_SLUG}} --state PROJECT_STATE.yaml
npm run check:native-ios-proof -- --root /path/to/{{APP_SLUG}} --state PROJECT_STATE.yaml
npm run check:11-star -- --root /path/to/{{APP_SLUG}} --state PROJECT_STATE.yaml
npm run check:emotional-design -- --root /path/to/{{APP_SLUG}} --state PROJECT_STATE.yaml
npm run check:content-assets -- --root /path/to/{{APP_SLUG}} --state PROJECT_STATE.yaml
npm run check:paid-ua -- --root /path/to/{{APP_SLUG}} --state PROJECT_STATE.yaml
npm run render:launch-cockpit -- --root /path/to/{{APP_SLUG}} --state PROJECT_STATE.yaml --out /path/to/{{APP_SLUG}}/launch-cockpit.html
```

Add lane-specific checks for attribution, UX patterns, content assets, 11-star experience, LaunchBench, and app tests whenever those lanes are in scope.

## Validator Hooks And Probes

**PostToolUse hooks** (`.claude/settings.json`) auto-fire depth checks after Write/Edit/Bash. Two prerequisites or they silently no-op: `jq` on `PATH`; `SKILL_ROOT` set to the installed skill's absolute path (else hooks fall back to `.`, local-dev only).

**Founder-gated reality probes** — real API keys, run via Doppler so secrets are never committed:

```bash
doppler run -- npx tsx <SKILL_ROOT>/scripts/probe-revenuecat.ts --root .   # REVENUECAT_SECRET_API_KEY
doppler run -- npx tsx <SKILL_ROOT>/scripts/probe-posthog.ts --root .       # POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY
```

Each writes a machine-verifiable JSON artifact (`revenue/revenuecat-proof.json`, `analytics/posthog-proof.json`) that `check:revenue` / `check:provider-proof` validate. Both keys are founder-only — never ask the agent for them.

**Screenshot grading is a separate pass** (producer ≠ verifier): after final PNGs are written, the hook routes to a fresh grader session that runs `grade-screenshots.ts`, scores each slot per `SCREENSHOT_RUBRIC.md`, and writes `screenshot-rubric-scores.json` with distinct `builder`/`grader` identities. `store_console` cannot be `done` until that exists. This raises the self-attestation bar but does not eliminate it — one agent can fabricate both identities, so founder review of the grading session is the ultimate backstop.
