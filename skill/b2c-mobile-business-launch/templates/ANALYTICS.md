# Analytics

Status: partial until live provider proof is recorded in `PROVIDER_PROOF.md`.

## Definition of Good

This section defines what "done" means for the `analytics_attribution` lane across three enforcement layers. The validator `check:attribution` enforces PRESENT and PROVEN as hard errors; OPTIMIZED items fire as warnings (taste stays human).

### PRESENT — artifact exists

The following must exist before the attribution lane can advance past "partial":

- `ANALYTICS.md` created and non-empty.
- `analytics-plan.html` created and non-empty.
- `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` contains `lanes.analytics_attribution.attribution_contract` with all five boolean fields (`screen_early`, `other_free_text`, `backend_persistence`, `anonymous_reconciliation`, `verified`) set to `true`.
- `attribution_source_selected` (or a documented alias) appears in implementation code or docs outside `PROJECT_STATE.yaml`.
- `self_reported_source` appears in implementation code or docs.
- Stable source keys include at minimum: `friend`, `app_store_search`, `creator`, `ai_search`, `other`.
- `self_reported_source` is in `person_properties`.

### PROVEN — objective on-disk or live evidence the work happened

The following are hard errors when `analytics_attribution.status` is `"done"`:

- At least one evidence path beyond `ANALYTICS.md` and `analytics-plan.html` is listed under `lanes.analytics_attribution.evidence` in `PROJECT_STATE.yaml`. Planning docs alone are not proof.
- Evidence paths must be relative file paths (containing `/` or `.`), not bare words. A bare word such as `posthog` with no slash or extension fires a warning — it is treated as a probable copy-paste from a template comment.
- Every non-placeholder local evidence path listed there must exist on disk. A path like `analytics/posthog-proof.json` means the file is present in the repo.
- `PROVIDER_PROOF.md` exists and contains a PostHog row with a non-placeholder evidence path. The `check:attribution` validator cross-checks the PostHog row's evidence path cell for placeholder text (`TODO`, `PLACEHOLDER`, `<…>`, `tbd`, etc.) and, when the path is local (not `https://…`), verifies it exists on disk.
- The PostHog row in `PROVIDER_PROOF.md` must not simultaneously claim a verified/live status while still carrying a placeholder evidence path.
- **Remote URL bypass is NOT accepted.** If the PostHog evidence cell in `PROVIDER_PROOF.md` is an `https://` URL, the static validator cannot fetch it and will fire a warning: `attribution.provider_proof_evidence_url_unverifiable`. The founder must either attest in-line (`founder-attested: YYYY-MM-DD`) or run the probe tool below to generate a local artifact instead.
- `analytics/posthog-proof.json` must exist, parse as valid JSON, carry the `"probe":"posthog@1"` fingerprint, record `event_count > 0`, and be no older than 72 hours. This file is produced by the founder-gated probe tool (see below). It must **not** be byte-identical to `analytics/posthog-proof.example.json` or below the 80-byte floor.

These checks also fire as warnings when the lane is `"partial"` and `attribution_contract.verified` is `true`, so placeholder drift is caught early.

Cross-lane gap: `check:attribution` is the single place that bridges the attribution boolean contract in `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` and the evidence ledger in `PROVIDER_PROOF.md`. Both must agree before the lane can be marked done.

### FOUNDER-GATED PROBE — required before marking done

The static validator cannot verify live PostHog data — a human must run the probe with real credentials. This must happen **after** real user traffic has arrived (not during development with synthetic test events).

**Step 1 — Ensure credentials are in Doppler**

```
doppler secrets set POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY=phc_...   # personal API key from PostHog Project Settings
doppler secrets set POSTHOG_PROJECT_ID=12345  # numeric project ID from the PostHog URL
# Optional — only for self-hosted deployments:
doppler secrets set POSTHOG_HOST=https://posthog.your-domain.com
```

**Step 2 — Run the probe (founder or designated team member only)**

```
doppler run -- npm run probe:posthog -- --root /path/to/business-repo
```

The probe queries PostHog for the `attribution_source_selected` event (or the custom event recorded in `PROJECT_STATE.yaml`) and writes `analytics/posthog-proof.json` with non-secret facts only: event name, count, query window, HTTP status, API host, and ISO timestamp. No API key is written to disk.

**Step 3 — Commit `analytics/posthog-proof.json`**

Commit the generated artifact. The `check:attribution` validator will verify its shape, fingerprint, count (`> 0`), and freshness (no older than 72 hours at audit time).

**Step 4 — Update `PROVIDER_PROOF.md`**

Change the PostHog row's evidence path cell from `analytics/posthog-proof.md` to `analytics/posthog-proof.json` and mark current status as `verified`.

**Security note:** The probe fingerprint `"probe":"posthog@1"` raises the bar versus hand-typed JSON but is not cryptographically unforgeable. Founder approval remains the ultimate backstop — only the founder who ran the probe can attest the count is real.

### OPTIMIZED — quality bar (warning only, taste stays human)

Record the following when optimizing attribution quality. These do not block launch but improve signal over time:

- Attribution dashboard in PostHog shows self-reported source breakdown with at least one full week of post-launch data.
- `other` free-text responses are reviewed and new source keys are added to the stable enum when a pattern emerges (e.g. a creator or community drives >5% of installs).
- Anonymous-to-identified stitching is verified in PostHog person timelines for at least five representative users.
- Backend/profile records for `self_reported_source` are exported and spot-checked after the first 100 signups.
- Attribution funnel (landing UTM → onboarding question → `attribution_source_selected` event → backend profile write) is documented in `ANALYTICS.md` with a verified percentage of users who complete each step.

## Event Contract

| Event | When | Properties | Provider proof |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| attribution_source_selected | early onboarding source screen | self_reported_source, self_reported_source_label | PostHog event and person property evidence |
| review_prompt_eligible | after first value is visible | first_value_id, surface | onboarding proof |
| review_prompt_requested | native review API called | platform, surface | onboarding proof |
| onboarding_started | first onboarding screen mounts | flow_id, step_id | onboarding proof |
| onboarding_step_viewed | each onboarding step renders | flow_id, step_id | onboarding proof |
| onboarding_answer_selected | personalization question answered | question_id, answer_id | onboarding proof |
| personalized_plan_viewed | first value / value-reveal screen | plan_id, surface | onboarding proof |
| activation_task_completed | first core action completed | task_id, surface | onboarding proof |
| paywall_viewed | paywall or offer screen renders | surface, offer_id, placement | revenue proof |
| purchase_completed | purchase confirmed by store/provider | product_id, plan_duration, surface | RevenueCat/Stripe webhook evidence |
| entitlement_active | entitlement granted/projected to backend | entitlement_id, source | RevenueCat webhook/projection evidence |
| referral_invite_started | user opens the invite flow | surface, channel | growth proof |
| referral_invite_completed | invitee accepts/redeems | inviter_id_hash, channel | growth proof |
| referral_unlock_earned | referral reward granted | reward_id, threshold | growth proof |
| share_started | share sheet/composer opened | surface, format | growth proof |
| share_completed | share confirmed by OS/platform callback | surface, format | growth proof |
| creator_code_applied | creator/referral code redeemed | code_source, campaign | growth proof |
| viral_format_signal_detected | a content format shows outlier traction | format_id, platform | growth proof |

Cross-doc rule: every event named in `ONBOARDING.md`, `EMOTIONAL_DESIGN.md`, or `VIRAL_GROWTH.md` must have a row here first — `check:analytics-catalog` reconciles them (warning while the analytics lane is partial, error at done).

## Emotion Card Events

Required when the Emotional Experience System is in scope (`EMOTIONAL_DESIGN.md`). Every card applied in the Card Application Map must name one of these events here before implementation; see `references/emotional-experience-measurement.md` for the full per-card catalog and counter-metrics. Do not invent new names — extend this table.

| Event | When | Properties | Counter-metric role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| emotion_card_fired | any Experience Card activates | card_id, surface, screen_id, flow_id, step_id, variant_id, session_id | system baseline |
| emotion_card_completed | user advances past the card moment | + completion_latency_ms | drop-off signal |
| emotion_card_abandoned | user exits during/just after a card fires | + abandon_reason, rage_tap_detected | dark-pattern watch |
| emotion_card_opt_out | user disables an emotional feature | card_id, opt_out_surface, opt_out_reason_shown | compulsion signal |
| commitment_made | commitment captured | commitment_type, commitment_value, flow_id, step_id | primary |
| commitment_echoed | the product reflects the commitment back | commitment_type, surface | reinforcement signal |
| peak_moment_reached | the designed session peak fires | surface, peak_type, session_id | peak-end proof |
| variable_reward_anticipation_started | anticipation moment begins before a reveal | surface, reward_type | pairing proof for variable_reward_revealed |
| variable_reward_revealed | reward shown after anticipation | surface, reward_type, reward_variant, anticipation_duration_ms, is_reduced_motion_fallback | primary + counter |
| perceived_effort_started / perceived_effort_completed | processing UI begins / ends | surface, effort_type, step_count, computation_type, real_step_ratio | labor-illusion proof |
| intent_mirror_shown / intent_mirror_continued | mirror pause displayed / user continues | surface, mirror_type, source_field, trigger_context | primary + conversion |

**Dark-Pattern Watch insight:** build a PostHog dashboard tile combining `emotion_card_abandoned` where `rage_tap_detected = true`, `emotion_card_opt_out` rate, sub-500ms reveal dismissals, `notification_disabled` (48h cohort), and `subscription_cancelled` within 24h of any card fire. Alert if any breaches its threshold for two consecutive weeks.
