# {{APP_NAME}} 11-Star Experience

This artifact defines the product's extreme experience, the feasible V1 slice, and how the same magic translates across product, onboarding, ads, store, engineering, lifecycle, and support.

## Experience Thesis

- Target user:
- Ordinary world:
- Desired transformation:
- One magical moment V1 must prove:
- Why a user would retell it:

## Star Ladder

| Stars | Label | User scene | Product behavior implied | Emotional reaction | What we learn |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Refund me | The app fails the basic promise or makes the user feel misled. | Identify failure states and trust breaks. | Regret, frustration. | What must never ship. |
| 2 | It technically works | The user can complete the task, but it feels slow, generic, or confusing. | Remove friction and explain recovery. | Tolerance, not love. | What minimum usability requires. |
| 5 | Expected experience | The app performs the promised task competently. | Deliver the core loop reliably. | "It worked." | The baseline users already expect. |
| 6 | Better than expected | The app adds clarity, polish, and one useful personalized detail. | Reflect user input, reduce uncertainty, and show progress. | Relief, trust. | The first feasible delight. |
| 7 | Way beyond | The app feels like it understood the user's context and prepared the next best step. | Use data, state, copy, and timing to personalize the moment. | "This was made for me." | The V1 magic candidate. |
| 10 | Impossible concierge | A human team manually creates the perfect end-to-end result for one user. | Identify the hidden service blueprint behind the product. | Amazement. | Which unscalable pieces might become product. |
| 11 | Absurd extreme | The product removes the user's problem so completely that the outcome feels unreal. | Reveal the emotional north star and what not to settle for. | They tell everyone. | The true ambition, not the V1 scope. |

## Line Of Feasibility

- Feasible for V1:
- Feasible with light manual/concierge help:
- Deferred inspiration:
- Explicitly not in scope:

## V1 Scalable Slice

- Experience slice to ship:
- Product behavior:
- Data/state/API requirements:
- Design and motion requirements:
- Analytics proof:
- Production-readiness proof:
