# Skill Loops — `b2c-mobile-business-launch`

Tracking file for: read the skill end to end, inventory every distinct repeatable
workflow with its trigger, then emit exactly one grounded five-part loop
(**trigger · action · proof · memory · stopping condition**) per workflow until
coverage is complete with no gaps or overlaps.

- **Skill read:** `skill/b2c-mobile-business-launch/SKILL.md` (full, 230 lines) +
  directory listings of `references/`, `templates/`, `scripts/`, and
  `package.json` scripts. Spot-read references: `change-cascade.md`,
  `control-plane.md`, `premium-mobile-craft.md`, `consumer-product-design-agency.md`.
- **Grounding rule:** every loop's **action** steps cite a named section of the
  skill — a SKILL.md `Start Here` step, a `Default Phase Flow` phase, a named
  contract section, a `references/*.md` file, a `templates/*` artifact, and/or a
  `package.json` validator script. Nothing in an action step is invented; if the
  skill does not name it, it is not in the loop.
- **Distinctness rule:** a workflow is "distinct" when it has its own trigger +
  its own primary durable artifact + (usually) its own validator. Where two
  references share a trigger, artifact, and validator they are merged so no two
  loops overlap.

## Stopping-Condition Audit

A loop's most dangerous failure mode is a **vague stop** — one that terminates on
judgment ("until it looks good", "complete", "reconciles", "feels right",
"matches reality", "evidence-backed") rather than on something a second observer
could check without an opinion. The loops below were ranked by how subjective the
original stop was, the worst rewritten first, then re-audited until none stopped
on judgment.

**Observable-stop rule (applied to every loop):** a stopping condition must name
**one of** — (a) a `package.json` command and its pass state (`check:*`,
`probe:*`, `launchbench`, `audit:ci`), (b) a grep/diff-checkable property of a
named artifact (e.g., "zero `TODO`/placeholder tokens", "Lexicon Lock grep
returns 0 cross-surface mismatches", "every surface row marked `updated|unaffected`"),
or (c) a discrete recorded state in `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` (a lane set to
`done|locked|blocked`, or a named founder-only gate). No stop may rest on an
adjective alone.

**Ranking (most-subjective originals, worst first) and the observable stop each now uses:**

| Rank | Loop | Original stop (subjective phrase) | Rewritten to stop on |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | L24 Premium craft | "'feels right' details are not left to the build" | `check:ux-patterns` passes **and** the `UX_PATTERNS.md` Premium Craft Details checklist has every row marked `done\|n-a` (grep finds no unresolved row) |
| 2 | L03 Orient/cockpit | "the cockpit matches reality" | `validate:launch-state` passes **and** `render:launch-cockpit` re-run exits 0 with no diff on a second run **and** `project.launch_tier` is set |
| 3 | L09 Research spec | "spec and name are evidence-backed and locked" | every claim row in the `SPEC.md`/`RESEARCH.md` evidence ledger carries a source cell (grep finds no empty source) **and** `lanes.research: locked` |
| 4 | L18 Launch trace | "every build decision traces to evidence and the lexicon is locked" | every row in the `LAUNCH_TRACE.md` decision table has a non-empty evidence cell (grep) **and** the Lexicon Lock grep returns 0 cross-surface term mismatches |
| 5 | L28 Listing packet | "complete and reconciled" | `APP_STORE_LISTING.md` has no `TODO`/empty required-field token (grep) **and** its App Privacy answers diff-match `PRIVACY.md` **and** the founder-approval gate row exists |
| 6 | L41 Privacy/terms | "exist and reconcile" | `PRIVACY.md`+`TERMS.md` have no placeholder token (grep) **and** App Privacy/Data Safety answers diff-match the `check:apple-requirements`/`check:google-play` packets |
| 7 | L08 Change cascade | "all surfaces reconciled" | every surface row in the cascade pass is marked `updated\|unaffected` (grep finds none unmarked) **and** the Lexicon Lock grep returns 0 mismatches — else the `change-cascade-incomplete` failure card is open |
| 8 | L43 GEO/SEO | "crawl/schema/AI-visibility checks pass" (unnamed) + unobservable "loaded before first edit" | `check:landing-funnel` passes (robots/sitemap/llms/schema asserts) **and** a live `curl` of the deployed page returns the JSON-LD block |
| 9 | L17 Launch narrative | "public claims limited to what is true" | `check:launch-narrative` passes (guardrail + cadence asserts) **and** `lanes.launch_narrative: locked` |
| 10 | L38 MobAI demos | "demo artifacts exist with a rerender path" | `DEMO_VIDEO.md`/`CONTENT_ASSETS.md` rows have non-empty `source` + `rerender` fields (grep) — else the MobAI-access blocker is recorded in `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` |

Loops 11–50 used softer completeness language ("exist", "recorded", "complete")
but each already owned a validator or a checkable artifact; the re-audit pass
below rewrites all 50 stops to name that command/artifact/state explicitly, so
every stop is verifiable without an opinion. See the **Re-audit Result** at the
end for the closed-loop confirmation.

## Loops

Each loop's **action** steps end with a `→` citation to the named skill section
that grounds them. Conventions used in every loop:

- **Memory** always includes the relevant `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` lane plus the
  lane's durable artifact — grounded in SKILL.md *Operating Posture* ("Keep
  `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` current") and *Autopilot Run Contract*.
- **Stopping condition** for every loop names a verifiable terminator — a
  `package.json` command's pass state, a grep/diff-checkable artifact property, or
  a discrete `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` lane/gate state (per the Observable-stop rule
  above). For provider-backed lanes that terminator is a probe/validator output or
  a named founder-only gate — grounded in SKILL.md *Autopilot Run Contract*
  (provider-proof paragraph) and `references/provider-proof.md`. No stop rests on
  an adjective ("complete", "reconciles", "looks good", "feels right").

### L01 — Runtime freshness gate (consumer side)
- **Trigger:** About to start substantial launch/design/store/revenue/build work and the installed skill runtime may be behind the source copy.
- **Action:**
  1. Run `npm run check:skill-version` from the installed skill (or compare `skill-version.json` manually if the helper is unavailable). → SKILL.md *Runtime Freshness Gate*; `Start Here` step 24.
  2. If stale, pause the original request and ask — via AskUserQuestion, or plainly if unavailable — update-now vs continue-on-installed. → SKILL.md *Runtime Freshness Gate*.
  3. Load `references/skill-versioning.md` for the commands/sync rules before acting on the answer. → `When To Load` (skill-versioning).
- **Proof:** `check:skill-version` output (fresh, or `skill_version.stale` recorded); the founder's decision captured.
- **Memory:** `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` records freshness status + the founder's update/continue choice.
- **Stopping condition:** `check:skill-version` reports not-stale, **or** `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` records the founder's decline / latest-source-unavailable as a named gate — then continue. Never proceed while `check:skill-version` reports `skill_version.stale` without a recorded decision.

### L02 — Session continuity / resume
- **Trigger:** New session, resume, status check, or handoff on an existing launch.
- **Action:**
  1. Read the Session Continuity source set: `AGENTS.md`, `PROJECT_STATE.yaml`, `launch-cockpit.html`, `ORCHESTRATION.md`, `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`, `FAILURE_CARDS.md`, and `git status --short`. → `Start Here` step 2 (Session Continuity).
  2. Route broad work through `APP_AGENTS.md` role prompts, or record the unavailable-subagent rationale. → *Operating Posture* (session continuity contract).
  3. Reconstruct phase/lane/provider/blocker state from durable files, not chat memory. → *Operating Posture*.
- **Proof:** `npm run check:continuity-contract`; reconstructed state matches the durable files.
- **Memory:** `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` (phase, lanes, blockers) re-confirmed; next action left in state before any pause.
- **Stopping condition:** `check:continuity-contract` passes **and** the `next_action` field in `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` is non-empty; resume the in-flight lane.

### L03 — Orient, scaffold & state/cockpit upkeep
- **Trigger:** Broad "launch this app / turn this transcript into a business" request; or any lane/provider/proof/blocker status change thereafter.
- **Action:**
  1. Recover source truth: business name, wedge, platform, monetization intent, current phase. → `Start Here` step 1; Phase 0.
  2. Create/refresh `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` from `templates/PROJECT_STATE.yaml`; set autonomy mode and confirm `project.launch_tier` (full/lite) with the founder. → `Start Here` step 2; Phase 0; Launch Tiers.
  3. Render `launch-cockpit.html` early and re-render whenever lane/provider/orchestration/proof/gate state changes (`npm run render:launch-cockpit`). → `Start Here` step 2; *Operating Posture*.
- **Proof:** `npm run validate:launch-state`; `launch-cockpit.html` re-rendered and reflects current lanes.
- **Memory:** `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` + `launch-cockpit.html` are the durable state contract.
- **Stopping condition:** `validate:launch-state` passes, `render:launch-cockpit` exits 0 and writes `launch-cockpit.html`, **and** `project.launch_tier` is set to `full|lite`. (Single-pass: re-runs only when a lane/provider/proof/gate field changes, never on a timer, so it cannot spin.)

### L04 — Paid-tool routing & fallback
- **Trigger:** Before using or replacing any paid/account-gated tool (AppKittie, XPOZ, Firecrawl, Higgsfield, MobAI, Fastlane, RevenueCat/Stripe/PostHog/Resend, etc.), or before a free fallback.
- **Action:**
  1. Load `references/paid-tool-routing.md` and classify each paid/account-gated lane. → `Start Here` step 3; Phase 0b.
  2. Ask the founder before substituting a free route; missing runtime access is not permission to spend tokens on a fallback. → `Start Here` step 3; *Operating Posture* (no silent downgrade).
  3. Record decisions in `TOOL_DECISIONS.md`, separating blocked access from founder-approved fallback. → Phase 0b.
- **Proof:** `npm run check:paid-tool-decisions`; `TOOL_DECISIONS.md` distinguishes blocked vs approved-fallback.
- **Memory:** `TOOL_DECISIONS.md` + `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` tool-routing entries.
- **Stopping condition:** `check:paid-tool-decisions` passes **and** every lane row in `TOOL_DECISIONS.md` reads exactly one of `confirmed-paid|founder-approved-fallback|blocked-pending-access` (grep finds no unmarked row).

### L05 — Secrets baseline & routing
- **Trigger:** Before any new API key, token, OAuth credential, webhook signing secret, service-account file, CI/deploy env var, or local `.env`.
- **Action:**
  1. Load `references/secrets-management.md` + `references/provider-state-recipes.md`; default to Doppler and `doppler run --` unless the founder approves another path. → `Start Here` step 4; Phase 0c.
  2. Create/refresh `SECRETS.md`; map local/staging/production locations; add `doppler.yaml` / names-only `.env.example` from `templates/secrets/` when useful. → `Start Here` step 4; Phase 0c.
  3. Refresh current provider docs / CLI `--help` before any setup command and record the docs/version basis. → `Start Here` step 4; *Source Freshness*.
- **Proof:** `npm run check:secrets` (secret-routing); `SECRETS.md` records the docs basis and no secret values are committed.
- **Memory:** `SECRETS.md` + `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` secrets entries.
- **Stopping condition:** `check:secrets` and `check:template-safety` both pass (routed homes recorded, zero plaintext secret values) **and** `SECRETS.md` records the docs/version basis.

### L06 — App-archetype detection & starter
- **Trigger:** Request matches a known product shape — social/community, AI chat/companion, habit/utility, or photo/AI-media.
- **Action:**
  1. Detect the shape and load the matching lane reference (`social-network-lane.md` / `ai-chat-companion-lane.md` / `habit-tracker-lane.md` / `photo-ai-media-lane.md`). → `Start Here` step 1a.
  2. Confirm the archetype-specific variant (content/surface/optional systems) via AskUserQuestion and record it in `PROJECT_STATE.yaml`. → `Start Here` step 1a.
  3. Copy the runnable starter from `templates/app-archetypes/<pack>/starter/` as the floor and customize with the pack's prompts instead of improvising the wiring. → `Start Here` step 1a.
- **Proof:** `npm run check:app-archetype` and `npm run check:archetype-starter`.
- **Memory:** `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` archetype field + the copied starter scaffold.
- **Stopping condition:** `check:app-archetype` and `check:archetype-starter` both pass **and** the archetype field in `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` is set (the pack feeds the normal lanes; it does not bypass them).

### L07 — Provider-proof verification
- **Trigger:** Before marking any provider-backed lane (analytics, revenue, email, store, security, engineering) done.
- **Action:**
  1. Load `references/provider-proof.md` and gather live proof for the lane (e.g., `npm run probe:posthog`, `npm run probe:revenuecat`). → `Start Here` *Autopilot Run Contract*; `Start Here` step (provider-proof load).
  2. Record proof or an explicit founder-only gate in `PROVIDER_PROOF.md`; setup prose alone cannot mark the lane done. → *Autopilot Run Contract*.
- **Proof:** `npm run check:provider-proof`; live probe output or a named founder-only gate in `PROVIDER_PROOF.md`.
- **Memory:** `PROVIDER_PROOF.md` + `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` lane proof field.
- **Stopping condition:** `check:provider-proof` passes — each provider lane in `PROVIDER_PROOF.md` carries a probe/log artifact **or** a named founder-only gate; no provider lane reads `done` without one.

### L08 — Change cascade
- **Trigger:** Any change to a launched/near-launch app's feature, copy, brand vocabulary, pricing, products, design, or data behavior once a listing/landing/assets exist.
- **Action:**
  1. Classify the change against the Change Cascade Map. → `references/change-cascade.md` *Change Cascade Map*.
  2. Enumerate impacted surfaces (in-app, ASC listing/products, RevenueCat, landing+meta/JSON-LD, SEO/GEO, email, analytics, legal, content) per `LOCALIZATION_MARKET_RESEARCH.md` tiers, and update or justify each. → `change-cascade.md` *Process* + *Surface Inventory*.
  3. Re-render derived assets (screenshots/App Preview/ad creative) where copy/UI changed; reconcile the lexicon. → `change-cascade.md` *Process* steps 4–5; *Operating Posture* (Cascade every change).
- **Proof:** Every impacted surface updated or marked unaffected; derived assets re-rendered; lexicon consistent across surfaces.
- **Memory:** `LAUNCH_TRACE.md`/`CHANGE_LOG.md` + `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` lane evidence; `launch-cockpit.html` re-rendered.
- **Stopping condition:** The cascade table enumerates every surface from the matching Change Cascade Map rows (non-empty), every row is marked `updated|unaffected` (grep finds none unmarked), the Lexicon Lock grep returns 0 cross-surface mismatches, and the cascade is recorded in `LAUNCH_TRACE.md`/`CHANGE_LOG.md` — otherwise the `change-cascade-incomplete` failure card stays open.

### L09 — Research-backed spec
- **Trigger:** Need category/pricing/keyword/competitor/review-social-language/name-collision evidence before the spec is treated as ready.
- **Action:**
  1. Run category economics, competitor deep-dives, review/social-language mining (AppKittie, XPOZ), keyword scan, and name-collision checks. → Phase 1; *Operating Posture* (Evidence beats taste).
  2. Quarantine untrusted public content (reviews/social/scraped pages) and keep an evidence ledger in `RESEARCH.md`. → *Claude vs Codex Routing And Dynamic Workflows*; Phase 1.
  3. Produce the revised `SPEC.md` with the evidence ledger; lock the name before ASO/landing depend on it. → Phase 1; *Operating Posture* (Lock phase outputs).
- **Proof:** `RESEARCH.md` evidence ledger + `SPEC.md` with each claim sourced to App Store/competitor/review/XPOZ/funnel evidence.
- **Memory:** `RESEARCH.md`, `SPEC.md` + `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` research lane.
- **Stopping condition:** The `RESEARCH.md`/`SPEC.md` evidence ledger has ≥1 claim row and none has an empty source cell (grep finds no empty source), a name-collision result is recorded, and `lanes.research` reads `locked`.

### L10 — Localization market research
- **Trigger:** Before localizing any surface (metadata/keywords/screenshots, paywall/offers, landing, email, paid storefronts) or choosing which locales to ship.
- **Action:**
  1. Load `references/localization-market-research.md`; research per-storefront keyword popularity, difficulty, and demand (AppKittie, ASA, ASC App Analytics, XPOZ). → `Start Here` step 17 (localization); Phase 1.
  2. Rank markets into priority tiers (Tier 1 full localize / Tier 2 metadata-only / Tier 3 defer); localize on demand, not language. → `Start Here` step 17; *Operating Posture*.
  3. Produce `LOCALIZATION_MARKET_RESEARCH.md` + `localization-market-research.html`. → `Start Here` step 17.
- **Proof:** `npm run check:localization-research`; the opportunity matrix + priority tiers exist with demand evidence.
- **Memory:** `LOCALIZATION_MARKET_RESEARCH.md` + `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` localization lane.
- **Stopping condition:** `check:localization-research` passes — `LOCALIZATION_MARKET_RESEARCH.md` carries the per-storefront matrix and Tier 1/2/3 assignments with demand evidence on each row.

### L11 — Analytics & attribution blueprint
- **Trigger:** Before onboarding/paywalls/funnels/store CTAs/referrals/email lifecycle/paid UA, or any build prompt that names events.
- **Action:**
  1. Load `references/analytics-attribution.md`; map current PostHog docs, identity plan, and the self-reported attribution contract (early screen, stable source keys, `other` free text, person property, backend persistence, anon→identified reconciliation). → `Start Here` step 10; Phase 1b.
  2. Build the event catalog, dashboards, experiment plan, and privacy guardrails in `ANALYTICS.md`; events named in `ONBOARDING.md`/`EMOTIONAL_DESIGN.md`/`VIRAL_GROWTH.md` must exist here first. → `Start Here` step 10; `When To Load` (analytics-catalog reconciliation).
  3. Render `analytics-plan.html` early so measurement is inspectable. → Phase 1b.
- **Proof:** `npm run check:analytics-catalog` + `npm run check:attribution`; `analytics-plan.html` rendered.
- **Memory:** `ANALYTICS.md` + `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` analytics lane.
- **Stopping condition:** `check:analytics-catalog` and `check:attribution` both pass — every event named in ONBOARDING/EMOTIONAL_DESIGN/VIRAL_GROWTH resolves in `ANALYTICS.md`, and the self-reported attribution fields are all present.

### L12 — 11-star experience
- **Trigger:** "11-star run / pass" or before `SPEC.md`, onboarding, ads, store screenshots, content, or eng plans are treated as ready.
- **Action:**
  1. Load `references/eleven-star-experience.md`; if the founder said "11-star run", follow the *11-Star Run Protocol* before any other output. → `Start Here` step 9; `When To Load` (eleven-star-experience).
  2. Define the 1/2/5/6/7/10/11-star ladder, draw the line of feasibility, and choose the V1 scalable slice. → Phase 1c.
  3. Produce `11_STAR_EXPERIENCE.md` + `11-star-experience.html`, then trace the V1 slice into product/design/analytics/revenue/store/content/build contracts. → `Start Here` step 9.
- **Proof:** `npm run check:11-star`; the ladder, feasibility line, and V1 slice exist and trace outward.
- **Memory:** `11_STAR_EXPERIENCE.md` + `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` 11-star lane.
- **Stopping condition:** `check:11-star` passes — `11_STAR_EXPERIENCE.md` carries the 1–11 ladder, a marked line of feasibility, and a single named V1 slice traced outward.

### L13 — Emotional experience design (producer)
- **Trigger:** Any product/onboarding/core-loop/paywall work whose 11-star target is 6★+; "charge this feature with emotion", "make users stick / build a habit", "apply the commitment/variable-reward/perceived-effort/intent-mirroring card".
- **Action:**
  1. Load the Emotional Experience System set (`emotional-design-system.md` hub + `experience-cards.md` index, loading only in-scope per-card files); peer references `consumer-product-design-agency.md`/`quality-lens.md` cross-referenced. → `Start Here` step 16a; `When To Load`.
  2. Produce `EMOTIONAL_DESIGN.md` + `emotional-design.html`: Emotional North Star, target emotional curve, and a Card Application Map tying each magical moment to one named card + a PostHog event + a bright-line guardrail + a reduced-motion fallback. → `Start Here` step 16a (producer path).
  3. For HIGH-risk cards (variable reward, streak, scarcity, urgency, social proof) add a user-control escape hatch, a counter-metric, and a truthfulness proof; run the bright-line dark-pattern test. → `Start Here` step 16a; `references/ethics-guardrail.md`.
- **Proof:** `npm run check:emotional-design`; every applied card emits a named event + ethics attestation; dark patterns vetoed.
- **Memory:** `EMOTIONAL_DESIGN.md` + `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` emotional_design lane.
- **Stopping condition:** `check:emotional-design` passes — every Card Application Map row names a card + PostHog event + bright-line guardrail + reduced-motion fallback, HIGH-risk rows carry escape-hatch/counter-metric/truthfulness fields, and the bright-line dark-pattern test reports none.

### L14 — Emotional design audit (auditor)
- **Trigger:** "Audit this app's emotional design / emotional intelligence" or "emotional UX audit".
- **Action:**
  1. Load the Emotional Experience System set + `emotional-experience-design.md` (Six-Lens Review). → `Start Here` step 16a (auditor path).
  2. Enumerate every journey on-device and score each step through the Six-Lens Review. → `Start Here` step 16a.
  3. Produce `EMOTIONAL_AUDIT.md` giving each finding a concrete pathway to a better state, with ethics attestation on applied cards. → `Start Here` step 16a (auditor path).
- **Proof:** `npm run check:emotional-design`; `EMOTIONAL_AUDIT.md` enumerates journeys with per-step Six-Lens scores and remediation paths.
- **Memory:** `EMOTIONAL_AUDIT.md` + `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` emotional_design lane evidence.
- **Stopping condition:** `check:emotional-design` passes against `EMOTIONAL_AUDIT.md` — every enumerated journey step has a Six-Lens score and a remediation row (grep finds no unscored step); dark-pattern findings are filed as compliance vetoes.

### L15 — Paid user-acquisition system
- **Trigger:** Before paid ads, Apple Search Ads, Meta/TikTok/Google campaigns, CPP campaign routing, MMP/SDK choices, paid creative tests, or spend-readiness claims.
- **Action:**
  1. Load `references/paid-user-acquisition.md`; choose one-channel focus, creative production, and a tracking baseline. → `Start Here` step 11; Phase 1d.
  2. Produce `PAID_UA.md`; trace blended reporting, RevenueCat LTV/CPA review, weekly cadence, and stop/scale rules into `ANALYTICS.md`/`REVENUE_OPS.md`/`APP_STORE_LISTING.md`/`LAUNCH_TRACE.md`. → `Start Here` step 11.
  3. Mark founder-only spend gates explicitly. → `Start Here` step 11; *Autopilot Run Contract* (founder gates).
- **Proof:** `npm run check:paid-ua`; one-channel choice + tracking baseline + stop/scale + spend gates present and traced.
- **Memory:** `PAID_UA.md` + `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` paid_ua lane.
- **Stopping condition:** `check:paid-ua` passes — `PAID_UA.md` records the one-channel choice, tracking baseline, RevenueCat LTV/CPA source, weekly cadence, and stop/scale rules; the `paid_user_acquisition` lane's spend gate stays unmet until founder-approved.

### L16 — Viral growth loop
- **Trigger:** Before referral unlocks, share-to-unlock, invite systems, social/comment loops, or features meant to spread on TikTok/Reels/Shorts.
- **Action:**
  1. Load `references/viral-growth-loops.md`; tie the 11-star slice to a product-led sharing/referral loop. → `Start Here` step 12; Phase 1e.
  2. Produce `VIRAL_GROWTH.md`; trace product loop, content loop, monetization timing, abuse controls, and stop/scale rules into `LAUNCH_TRACE.md`/`ONBOARDING.md`/`REVENUE_OPS.md`/`UGC_PLAYBOOK.md`/`ANALYTICS.md`. → `Start Here` step 12.
  3. Add abuse controls and analytics proof for every loop. → `Start Here` step 12.
- **Proof:** `npm run check:viral-growth`; loop + abuse controls + analytics proof + stop/scale present and traced.
- **Memory:** `VIRAL_GROWTH.md` + `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` viral_growth lane.
- **Stopping condition:** `check:viral-growth` passes — `VIRAL_GROWTH.md` carries the product loop, abuse controls, analytics-event proof, and stop/scale rules, each traced to the named downstream docs.

### L17 — Launch narrative & cadence
- **Trigger:** Before drafting the announcement, the launch-day sequence, or the weekly release rhythm.
- **Action:**
  1. Load `references/launch-narrative-cadence.md`; set a feeling-first launch thesis + named emotional angle and the tentpole-plus-weekly-cadence model. → `Start Here` step 12a; Phase 1e.
  2. Produce `growth/LAUNCH_NARRATIVE.md` with a launch-day run-of-show, post copy in fenced blocks passing the 2026 guardrails (no hashtags/emojis; link in the first reply not the main post), a measurement plan, and founder-only posting gates. → `Start Here` step 12a.
  3. Trace it into `EMOTIONAL_DESIGN.md`/`11_STAR_EXPERIENCE.md`/`CONTENT_ASSETS.md`/`VIRAL_GROWTH.md`/`APP_STORE_LISTING.md`/`ANALYTICS.md`/`LAUNCH_TRACE.md`. → `Start Here` step 12a.
- **Proof:** `npm run check:launch-narrative`; copy passes the guardrails and the cadence/run-of-show exist.
- **Memory:** `growth/LAUNCH_NARRATIVE.md` + `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` launch_narrative lane.
- **Stopping condition:** `check:launch-narrative` passes (2026 copy-guardrail + tentpole/weekly-cadence + run-of-show asserts) **and** `lanes.launch_narrative` reads `locked`.

### L18 — Launch trace & build contracts
- **Trigger:** Moving from research to product experience / brand-design / implementation; deciding whether `TECH_SPEC.md` is needed.
- **Action:**
  1. Load `references/flow-traceability.md`; create `LAUNCH_TRACE.md` mapping evidence → product/11-star/paid-UA/viral/brand/design/build/analytics/revenue/privacy/store/verification. → `Start Here` step 8; Phase 1f.
  2. Create `TECH_SPEC.md` when data/API/state/permissions/platform/integration behavior must be built. → `Start Here` step 8; Phase 1f.
  3. Run the Lexicon Lock so one vocabulary holds across surfaces. → `flow-traceability.md` (Lexicon Lock, per change-cascade pairing).
- **Proof:** `LAUNCH_TRACE.md` connects each build decision back to evidence; `TECH_SPEC.md` exists when implementation is in scope.
- **Memory:** `LAUNCH_TRACE.md`, `TECH_SPEC.md` + `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` trace lane.
- **Stopping condition:** The `LAUNCH_TRACE.md` decision table is non-empty and every row has a non-empty evidence cell (grep) **and** the Lexicon Lock grep returns 0 cross-surface term mismatches; `TECH_SPEC.md` exists when implementation is in scope.

### L19 — Security architecture & release gate
- **Trigger:** Before threat modeling, hardening, OWASP MASVS/ASVS checks, MobSF/static scans, app-integrity decisions, Sentry/release-health, or any security-readiness claim.
- **Action:**
  1. Load `references/security-release-hardening.md`; build the threat model, data classification, and platform-hardening decisions in `SECURITY.md`. → `Start Here` step 5; Phase 1g.

  3. Render `security-review.html`, resolve/accept risks, and attach proof to `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`. → Phase 5c.
- **Proof:** `npm run check:security`; `security-review.html` rendered with scan/proof attached.
- **Memory:** `SECURITY.md`, `security-review.html` + `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` security lane.
- **Stopping condition:** `check:security` passes and `security-review.html` is rendered with scan output attached to `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md` — each residual risk is marked `resolved|accepted` with a named owner, or carries a founder gate.

### L20 — Design Room (state → mutate → version → render)
- **Trigger:** Any design, visual-system, cross-surface, App Store creative, landing, onboarding, paywall, or marketing-surface work.
- **Action:**
  1. **STATE:** read `state/business.json` + `state/theme.tokens.json` (seed from `state/` or `templates/state/` if missing). → SKILL.md *Design Room Contract* step 1.
  2. **MUTATE:** make one coherent JSON state mutation — no one-off proposal doc or ad-hoc HTML proof. → *Design Room Contract* step 2.
  3. **VERSION + RENDER:** `npm run validate:design-state`, `npm run render:design-room`, version with git (`git tag baseline/<name>`), and show `design-room.html` / `dist/design-room/`. → *Design Room Contract* steps 3–4; *Operating Posture* (design versioning is git state).
- **Proof:** `npm run check:design-room` + `npm run validate:design-state`; rendered Design Room reflects the state mutation.
- **Memory:** `state/business.json`, `state/theme.tokens.json`, git baselines + `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` design lane.
- **Stopping condition:** `check:design-room` and `validate:design-state` both pass **and** the mutation is committed as a git baseline tag (`baseline/<name>`) with `design-room.html` re-rendered from it.

### L21 — Token promotion
- **Trigger:** Theme tokens change and the design is accepted.
- **Action:**
  1. Run the token promotion path so `state/theme.tokens.json` flows into app-facing `design-system/` artifacts before implementation relies on the visual system (`npm run promote:design-tokens`). → SKILL.md *Design Room Contract* (token promotion paragraph); `Start Here` step 15.
  2. Reconcile promoted tokens with `DESIGN.md` and downstream generated assets. → *Operating Posture* (token promotion as enforced contract).
- **Proof:** `npm run check:token-promotion`; promoted `design-system/` artifacts match the accepted tokens.
- **Memory:** `design-system/` artifacts + `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` design lane token state.
- **Stopping condition:** `check:token-promotion` passes — the promoted `design-system/` artifacts diff-match `state/theme.tokens.json` before implementation consumes them.

### L22 — UX patterns (Refero)
- **Trigger:** Before flow maps, state matrices, `UX_PATTERNS.md`, bug-trap coverage, or replacing Refero with a free fallback.
- **Action:**
  1. Load `references/refero-ux-patterns.md`; research web/mobile patterns via Refero, or a founder-approved free route using `templates/ux-patterns/`. → `Start Here` step 15; `When To Load` (refero-ux-patterns).
  2. Produce `UX_PATTERNS.md` with flow maps, state matrices, a Premium Craft Details section, and bug traps. → `When To Load`; `premium-mobile-craft.md` pattern contract.
- **Proof:** `npm run check:ux-patterns`; flow maps + state matrices + bug traps present.
- **Memory:** `UX_PATTERNS.md` + `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` design/ux lane.
- **Stopping condition:** `check:ux-patterns` passes — `UX_PATTERNS.md` carries flow maps, state matrices, and bug traps for each V1 surface and records the Refero/fallback source.

### L23 — Onboarding conversion
- **Trigger:** Before onboarding quizzes, personalization, attribution questions, demo videos, App Review popups, paywall timing, trials, or first-session activation.
- **Action:**
  1. Load `references/onboarding-conversion.md`; design the onboarding sequence as the sales surface (value reveal, personalization/attribution capture, paywall/offer routing). → `Start Here` step 16; Phase 1c surfaces.
  2. Place the native App Review popup immediately after the first value/value-reveal step. → `Start Here` step 16.
  3. Wire onboarding analytics events into `ANALYTICS.md` (catalog reconciliation). → `Start Here` step 16; L11.
- **Proof:** `npm run check:onboarding`; review-prompt placement and paywall timing satisfy the validator.
- **Memory:** `ONBOARDING.md` + `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` onboarding lane.
- **Stopping condition:** `check:onboarding` passes — the native App Review prompt sits immediately after the first value-reveal step and the paywall-timing/offer rows are present in `ONBOARDING.md`, before build handoff.

### L24 — Premium mobile craft
- **Trigger:** Before in-app UI build/polish, wiring press states/animation/haptics/keyboard/loading-empty states, or a "premium feel" request.
- **Action:**
  1. Load `references/premium-mobile-craft.md`; apply the invisible-details layer under `design-visual-system.md`/`refero-ux-patterns.md`/`emotional-design-system.md`. → `Start Here` step (premium craft, When To Load line 205).
  2. Start from the shipped boilerplate `templates/design-system/PremiumCraft.swift` (with RN/Flutter parity), honoring Reduce Motion and reading `DesignTokens.Motion`. → `premium-mobile-craft.md` (boilerplate section).
  3. Record the Premium Craft Details + bug traps in `templates/ux-patterns/UX_PATTERNS.md`. → `premium-mobile-craft.md` (pattern contract).
- **Proof:** Press-state/haptics/keyboard/skeleton/empty-state details are implemented from the boilerplate and reflected in `UX_PATTERNS.md`; reduced-motion fallback present.
- **Memory:** `UX_PATTERNS.md` Premium Craft section + `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` design lane.
- **Stopping condition:** `check:ux-patterns` passes **and** the Premium Craft Details checklist in `UX_PATTERNS.md` has every row marked `done|n-a` (grep finds no unresolved row), including the reduced-motion fallback.

### L25 — Content assets / Remotion / generated visuals
- **Trigger:** Before rendered videos/stills, app-preview clips, ad/social/content variants, or claiming local rendered content assets are ready.
- **Action:**
  1. Load `references/remotion-content-assets.md` (and Higgsfield recipes in `tool-recipes.md`); decide Higgsfield vs Remotion local rendering per `paid-tool-routing.md`. → `Start Here` steps 15/22; `When To Load` (remotion-content-assets).
  2. Produce assets carrying current `DESIGN.md` tokens; record each in `CONTENT_ASSETS.md` with `prompt_brief`, `source_job_id`, `virality_score`, marking superseded entries. → `change-cascade.md` *Generated-Asset Regeneration* guardrails.
  3. Keep generated output as supporting art only — never substituting for truthful real app UI in screenshots/App Preview. → `change-cascade.md` guardrails.
- **Proof:** `npm run check:content-assets`; assets recorded with briefs/job ids and token basis.
- **Memory:** `CONTENT_ASSETS.md` (and `DEMO_VIDEO.md` where applicable) + `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` content lane.
- **Stopping condition:** `check:content-assets` passes — every `CONTENT_ASSETS.md` row has non-empty `prompt_brief`/`source_job_id` and a token basis, superseded rows are marked, and spend is founder-approved per `check:paid-tool-decisions`.

- **Action:**
  1. Load `references/control-plane.md`; add the new panel over `state/business.json` + `state/theme.tokens.json` + `state/schema/business.schema.json` rather than a separate store. → `Start Here` step 15 (control-plane load); `control-plane.md` *Current Panel*.
  2. Keep the workspace read model consistent with the rendered panels. → *Operating Posture* (Control Plane as enforced contract).
- **Proof:** `npm run check:control-plane` + `npm run check:business-control-plane-workspace`.
- **Memory:** `state/business.json`/schema + the generated workspace read model + `PROJECT_STATE.yaml`.
- **Stopping condition:** `check:control-plane` and `check:business-control-plane-workspace` both pass — new panels render from `state/business.json` + `state/theme.tokens.json` with no separate store.

  2. Plan ASA, ratings/reviews loops, and post-launch monitoring; localize per the `LOCALIZATION_MARKET_RESEARCH.md` tiers (L10). → `Start Here` step 17.
- **Proof:** `npm run check:aso-metadata`; metadata fields validate against keyword/length rules.
- **Memory:** `APP_STORE_LISTING.md` ASO sections + `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` aso lane.
- **Stopping condition:** `check:aso-metadata` passes — every `APP_STORE_LISTING.md` ASO field is within its length/keyword rule and uses the locked name from L09.

### L28 — App Store listing prep packet
- **Trigger:** Before listing fields, interactive privacy questionnaire, IAP/subscription field maps, custom product pages, in-app events, or App Store marketing material tied to the design system.
- **Action:**
  1. Load `references/app-store-listing-prep.md`; assemble `APP_STORE_LISTING.md` (default listing fields, App Privacy answers, pricing/subscription setup, CPPs, in-app events, localization matrix). → `Start Here` step 17; Phase 3.
  2. Align pricing/subscription copy with RevenueCat/Stripe/web-funnel (L40) and mark founder-only approval gates. → `Start Here` step 17.
- **Proof:** `APP_STORE_LISTING.md` packet complete; App Privacy answers reconcile with `PRIVACY.md` (L41) and `GOOGLE_PLAY_RELEASE.md` Data Safety (L34).
- **Memory:** `APP_STORE_LISTING.md` + `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` listing lane.
- **Stopping condition:** `APP_STORE_LISTING.md` exists with every required-field section present and carries no `TODO`/empty token (grep), its App Privacy answers diff-match `PRIVACY.md`, and a founder-approval gate row precedes ASC entry.

### L29 — Apple signing & release readiness

- **Proof:** `npm run check:apple-signing`; the signing packet is complete with founder-gated account steps flagged.
- **Memory:** `APPLE_SIGNING.md` + `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` signing lane.
- **Stopping condition:** `check:apple-signing` passes — `APPLE_SIGNING.md` records each of account/Team ID/bundle ID/cert/profile/archive/upload state, with founder-only enrollment/credential steps flagged as named gates.

### L30 — Apple App Store requirements (privacy manifest)
- **Trigger:** Before ASC upload readiness — `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`, required-reason APIs, third-party SDK manifests, App Privacy answers.
- **Action:**
  1. Load `references/apple-app-store-requirements` guidance; create `APPLE_APP_STORE_REQUIREMENTS.md` reconciling `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`, `NSPrivacyCollectedDataTypes`/`NSPrivacyAccessedAPITypes`, required-reason API reasons, tracking domains, SDK manifests/signatures, App Privacy answers, purpose strings, ATT, account deletion, review notes, and archive/upload warnings. → `Start Here` step 17; Phase 3.
  2. Require founder approval before ASC upload/submission. → `Start Here` step 17.
- **Proof:** `npm run check:apple-requirements`; the packet reconciles manifest/privacy answers/required-reason APIs.
- **Memory:** `APPLE_APP_STORE_REQUIREMENTS.md` + `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` apple-requirements lane.
- **Stopping condition:** `check:apple-requirements` passes — the validator confirms `APPLE_APP_STORE_REQUIREMENTS.md` matches the manifest, required-reason APIs, and App Privacy answers, with a founder-approval gate row before upload.

### L31 — Store console workflow
- **Trigger:** Before "where do I click / what do I paste" handoffs in App Store Connect or Google Play Console.
- **Action:**
  1. Load `references/store-console-workflow.md`; produce `STORE_CONSOLE.md` + `store-console.html` naming the exact ASC/Play pages, the field-by-field paste values, and which items need founder approval. → `Start Here` step 17; Phase 3.
- **Proof:** `npm run check:store-console`; the packet maps each console page to its paste values and approval gates.
- **Memory:** `STORE_CONSOLE.md` + `store-console.html` + `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` store-console lane.
- **Stopping condition:** `check:store-console` passes — `STORE_CONSOLE.md` maps every required ASC/Play page to its paste values and marks each founder-approval gate (grep finds no "set this up in the console" placeholder).

### L32 — ASC CLI automation

- **Action:**
  1. Load `references/app-store-connect-cli.md`; refresh local `asc` CLI help first. → `Start Here` step 17; *Source Freshness*.
  2. If `asc` is installed, run the auth-recovery ladder (keychain profiles, account-level keys, `asc auth init/login`) instead of reporting "cannot access ASC"; report any missing app/cert/RevenueCat record as a founder-gated setup step with the exact next command. → *Operating Posture* (ASC access as setup, not a wall).
- **Proof:** `asc` auth succeeds or the exact founder-gated next command is recorded; CLI command basis matches refreshed help.
- **Memory:** `STORE_CONSOLE.md`/`APP_STORE_LISTING.md` ASC-CLI notes + `PROJECT_STATE.yaml`.
- **Stopping condition:** `asc` commands exit 0, **or** each blocker is recorded in `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` as a founder-gated step with the exact next command (grep finds no bare "cannot access ASC" string).

### L33 — Store screenshots production
- **Trigger:** Store screenshots needed (raw app capture → composed iPhone/iPad/Play assets).
- **Action:**
  1. Capture raw app screens via MobAI / Codex Desktop native iOS / XcodeBuildMCP / serve-sim / SnapshotPreviews (preview-only when used) per the screenshot matrix. → `Start Here` step 17; Phase 3 (screenshot matrix).
  2. Produce `SCREENSHOTS.md`; compose copy-led iPhone/iPad/Play assets via ParthJadhav/app-store-screenshots or an equivalent export board with current device wells; validate and visual-QA. → `Start Here` step 17.
- **Proof:** `npm run check:store-screenshots` + `npm run grade:screenshots`; composed assets pass device-well validation + visual QA.
- **Memory:** `SCREENSHOTS.md` + `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` screenshots lane.
- **Stopping condition:** `check:store-screenshots` and `grade:screenshots` both pass — composed assets clear device-well validation and the visual-QA grade threshold, or blocked sets are named in `SCREENSHOTS.md`.

### L34 — Google Play release
- **Trigger:** Android in scope — platforms include android, or an android bundle id exists.
- **Action:**
  1. Load `references/google-play-release.md`; produce `GOOGLE_PLAY_RELEASE.md` (developer account type, Data Safety reconciled with iOS labels, content rating, Play App Signing/AAB, target API level, release tracks). → `Start Here` step 17; Phase 3.
  2. Plan the personal-account closed-testing gate (12 testers / 14 days) into the launch calendar from day one and triage the pre-launch report. → `Start Here` step 17.
- **Proof:** `npm run check:google-play`; Data Safety reconciles with iOS privacy labels and the closed-testing gate is scheduled.
- **Memory:** `GOOGLE_PLAY_RELEASE.md` + `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` google-play lane.
- **Stopping condition:** `check:google-play` passes — `GOOGLE_PLAY_RELEASE.md` Data Safety diff-matches the iOS privacy labels and the closed-testing gate is on the calendar, or each blocker is recorded.

### L35 — Engineering orchestration (CE + production readiness)
- **Trigger:** Before actual app implementation, backend/frontend work, generated builder prompts, parallel agents/worktrees, or production-readiness claims.
- **Action:**
  1. Load `compound-engineering-routing.md` + `parallel-agent-orchestration.md` + `engineering-orchestration.md`; route through CE freshness, `ce-brainstorm` (if product shape unresolved), `ce-plan`, `ce-work`/`ce-worktree`, `ce-code-review`, CE test + proof skills. → `Start Here` step 13; Phase 5b.
  2. If CE is unavailable, record the fallback in state and run the Standalone Engineering Loop (plan → bounded slices → adversarial review → test → proof) with the same evidence bar. → `Start Here` step 13 (`engineering-orchestration.md` §1b).
  3. Produce `ENGINEERING_PLAN.md`, `ORCHESTRATION.md`, and `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`; serialize shared resources and run MobAI/native iOS E2E (L38/L39). → Phase 5b.
- **Proof:** `npm run check:compound-engineering` + `npm run check:orchestration`; all five engineering stages (plan/slice/review/test/proof) carry evidence.
- **Memory:** `ENGINEERING_PLAN.md`, `ORCHESTRATION.md`, `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md` + `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` engineering lane.
- **Stopping condition:** `check:compound-engineering` and `check:orchestration` both pass — `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md` carries an evidence artifact for each of the five stages (plan/slice/review/test/proof); the `engineering` lane stays `partial` until all five are present.

### L36 — Backend data contract
- **Trigger:** Before schema/auth prompts run or `TECH_SPEC.md` data/API sections harden; founder wants Firebase/custom instead of the Supabase default.
- **Action:**
  1. Load `references/backend-data-contract.md`; record Backend Selection (supabase default / firebase / custom) with a reason, the Data Model, the tested Authorization Model (RLS/security rules/middleware authz), and Migrations And Environments. → `Start Here` step 13; Phase 5b.
  2. Adapt archetype prompts to the selected route instead of running the Supabase defaults verbatim. → `Start Here` step 13.
- **Proof:** `npm run check:backend-contract`; the authorization model is tested (RLS/security-rule tests) and the data contract is complete.
- **Memory:** `TECH_SPEC.md` Data Contract section + `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` backend lane.
- **Stopping condition:** `check:backend-contract` passes — `TECH_SPEC.md` Data Contract records backend selection + reason, data model, a passing authz test (RLS/security-rule), and migrations/environments.

### L37 — App agent roster & repo entrypoints
- **Trigger:** Before builder handoff bundles, business `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`, `APP_AGENTS.md`, or `agents/` role prompts.
- **Action:**
  1. Load `references/app-agent-roster.md`; fill the shipped `templates/repo-agent-entrypoints/` `AGENTS.md`+`CLAUDE.md` with app-specific context so future agents keep using this skill without another founder prompt. → `Start Here` step 14; Phase 5.
  2. Create `APP_AGENTS.md` + the seven role prompts under `agents/` (orchestrator, marketing-guru, engineering-leader, product-leader, design-guru, customer-success, security-architect). → `Start Here` step 14.
- **Proof:** `npm run check:agent-entrypoints`; the entrypoints + roster + seven roles exist and route back to the skill.
- **Memory:** business `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`, `APP_AGENTS.md`, `agents/` + `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` handoff lane.

- **Proof:** `npm run check:revenue` + `npm run probe:revenuecat`; sandbox + production purchase validation evidence (provider-proof, L07).
- **Memory:** `REVENUE_OPS.md` + `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` revenue lane.
- **Stopping condition:** `check:revenue` and `probe:revenuecat` both pass — `REVENUE_OPS.md` records a sandbox purchase granting the entitlement in app+backend, the production gate is marked founder-only, and prices diff-match `APP_STORE_LISTING.md`.

### L41 — Privacy & terms
- **Trigger:** Before drafting/publishing privacy policy, terms, EULA, subscription terms, data-deletion flows, or app-store privacy disclosures.
- **Action:**
  1. Load `references/privacy-terms.md`; draft `PRIVACY.md` + `TERMS.md` (and account-deletion/subscription terms) from `templates/PRIVACY.md`/`TERMS.md`. → `Start Here` step 20.
  2. Reconcile App Store App Privacy answers + Play Data Safety with actual data collection/SDKs (pairs with L28/L30/L34). → `Start Here` step 20; `change-cascade.md` privacy row.
- **Proof:** `PRIVACY.md`/`TERMS.md` published; privacy answers reconcile with the manifest, Data Safety, and analytics/SDK reality.
- **Memory:** `PRIVACY.md`, `TERMS.md` + `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` legal lane.
- **Stopping condition:** `PRIVACY.md` and `TERMS.md` exist, are non-empty, and carry no placeholder token (grep), and their App Privacy/Data Safety answers diff-match the `check:apple-requirements`/`check:google-play` packets; publishing stays a founder gate.

### L42 — Resend email ops
- **Trigger:** Before Resend domains/keys, transactional/lifecycle/broadcast email, contacts/topics, webhooks, inbound, unsubscribe, or deliverability work.
- **Action:**
  1. Load `references/resend-email-ops.md`; configure sender-domain DNS (SPF/DKIM), API keys (via L05), and starter templates from `templates/resend/email-templates.ts`. → `Start Here` step 21; Phase 4.
  2. Produce `EMAIL_OPS.md` recording the SPF/DKIM basis, unsubscribe handling, and the `DESIGN.md` brand-token mapping; populate brand/tone from `DESIGN.md`/`11_STAR_EXPERIENCE.md`. → `Start Here` step 21; `When To Load` (resend).
- **Proof:** `npm run check:email`; proof artifacts + `EMAIL_OPS.md` with DNS basis, unsubscribe, and brand-token mapping (provider-proof, L07).
- **Memory:** `EMAIL_OPS.md` + `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` email lane.
- **Stopping condition:** `check:email` passes — `EMAIL_OPS.md` records the SPF/DKIM basis, unsubscribe handling, the DESIGN.md brand-token mapping, and a Resend send/webhook log proof.

### L43 — GEO/SEO public visibility
- **Trigger:** Before editing any file with landing/policy/blog copy, component-level copy, screenshot metadata, `robots.txt`, `llms.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, schema, or metadata — not after the rewrite.
- **Action:**
  1. Load `references/geo-seo.md` before the first file edit; set target keywords, citability content, brand-entity signals, schema/JSON-LD, and AI-crawler access. → `Start Here` step 18.
  2. Verify crawlability, schema marking, and AI-search discoverability after edits. → `Start Here` step 18; *Operating Posture* (Verify what shipped).
- **Proof:** Public pages are crawlable, schema-marked, and AI-discoverable (overlaps with `check:landing-funnel` checks where the funnel exists).
- **Memory:** landing/policy files + `LAUNCH_TRACE.md` SEO/GEO notes + `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` geo lane.
- **Stopping condition:** `check:landing-funnel` passes (robots/sitemap/llms/schema asserts) **and** a live `curl` of the deployed page returns the expected JSON-LD block.

### L44 — Pre-launch funnel (landing/waitlist)
- **Trigger:** Phase 4 — landing page, waitlist/referral loop, web monetization funnel, domain, routed support/privacy email, live deploy verification.
- **Action:**
  1. Build the landing page + waitlist/referral loop (optional web monetization funnel from L40); wire domain, routed support/privacy email aliases (L42), PostHog/GA/Sentry, security headers, and GEO/SEO (L43). → Phase 4.
  2. Run local build, deploy checks, live HTTP checks, form-submission smoke tests, and analytics-event verification. → *Operating Posture* (Verify what shipped).
- **Proof:** `npm run check:landing-funnel`; live deploy + form submission + analytics events verified.
- **Memory:** landing repo/assets + `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` funnel lane.
- **Stopping condition:** `check:landing-funnel` passes and the live deploy is verified by an HTTP 200 + a form-submission smoke test + a PostHog event appearing; public deploy stays a founder gate.

### L45 — UGC creator engine
- **Trigger:** Before founder-led organic social, UGC sourcing, creator contracts/payments, or format-discovery tests.
- **Action:**
  1. Load `references/ugc-creator-engine.md` (and `viral-growth-loops.md` first when the plan depends on referrals/share-to-unlock/paywall timing). → `Start Here` step 22; `When To Load` (ugc-creator-engine).
  2. Produce `UGC_PLAYBOOK.md`: UGC fit decision, 90-day creator format-discovery plan, sourcing approach, creator budget, script/format loop, disclosure rules, and stop/scale thresholds. → Deliverable Standard (UGC fit).
- **Proof:** `UGC_PLAYBOOK.md` complete with fit decision, 90-day plan, disclosure rules, and stop/scale thresholds; creator spend founder-gated (L04).
- **Memory:** `UGC_PLAYBOOK.md` + `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` ugc lane.
- **Stopping condition:** `UGC_PLAYBOOK.md` contains all five named rows — fit decision, 90-day plan, budget, disclosure rules, stop/scale thresholds — each present and non-empty (grep finds none missing or empty); creator payments/contracts stay a named founder gate.

### L46 — Fastlane growth ops
- **Trigger:** After launch approval/public beta, or usefastlane.ai setup, social account connection, Blitz angles/preferences, generated content, scheduling, or social analytics.
- **Action:**
  1. Load `references/fastlane-growth-ops.md`; set up the Fastlane workspace, social connections, and Blitz angles/preferences, feeding MobAI/native iOS/Higgsfield/Remotion media inputs (L25/L38/L39). → `Start Here` step 22; Phase 6.
  2. Produce `FASTLANE_OPS.md`; QA generated/rendered content and run the weekly iteration loop. → Phase 6.
- **Proof:** `FASTLANE_OPS.md` workspace + connections + angles recorded; scheduling/posting founder-approved; analytics snapshots captured.
- **Memory:** `FASTLANE_OPS.md` + `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` fastlane lane.
- **Stopping condition:** `FASTLANE_OPS.md` exists with the workspace, connections, Blitz-angles, and weekly-loop sections present and a QA-pass log line recorded; social-account connection and posting/scheduling stay named founder gates.

### L47 — Post-launch operations
- **Trigger:** App live (phase_6/6b), "what now", weekly ops, incident response, review-response, or retention-review work.
- **Action:**
  1. Load `references/post-launch-operations.md`; produce `POST_LAUNCH_OPS.md` (Weekly Operating Rhythm, Crash Triage with route + release gate, Review Responses with an SLA, Release/Hotfix Cadence with staged rollout, Retention Review with cohort source + churn split, Support Operations). → `Start Here` step 22a; Phase 6b.
  2. Write `LAUNCH_RETRO.md` at launch +7/30/90 days so misses become failure cards + LaunchBench candidates; revisit any lite-tier deferred lanes at day 30. → Phase 6b.
- **Proof:** `npm run check:post-launch`; the weekly rhythm + retro cadence are present with SLAs and cohort sources.
- **Memory:** `POST_LAUNCH_OPS.md`, `LAUNCH_RETRO.md` + `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` post_launch_ops lane.
- **Stopping condition:** `check:post-launch` passes — `POST_LAUNCH_OPS.md` carries the weekly rhythm with a review-response SLA + crash route + cohort source, and `LAUNCH_RETRO.md` exists at the +7/30/90 cadence.

### L48 — Source-freshness maintenance (maintainer)
- **Trigger:** Maintaining this skill, adding external URLs, refreshing third-party docs/commands, or reviewing weekly source diffs.
- **Action:**
  1. Load `references/source-freshness-maintenance.md`; register every new external URL in `references/source-registry.yaml`. → `Start Here` step 25; AGENTS.md *Source Freshness*.
  2. Refresh official docs / local CLI `--help` before changing any fast-moving command guidance and record the basis. → AGENTS.md *Source Freshness*.
  3. Run `npm run check:source-registry` and `npm run refresh:source-freshness`. → AGENTS.md Commands.
- **Proof:** `npm run check:source-registry` passes; refreshed candidates are reviewed before becoming accepted policy.
- **Memory:** `source-registry.yaml` + the reference/template/validator updates backing each candidate.
- **Stopping condition:** `check:source-registry` passes — every external URL is in `source-registry.yaml` with a recorded docs basis; auto-discovered candidates stay flagged until backed by a reference/template/validator update.

### L49 — LaunchBench / failure-cards / coverage audit
- **Trigger:** Before any launch-readiness claim, after a repeated agent miss, or when adding a validator/scenario.
- **Action:**
  1. Load `references/launchbench-evals.md` + `references/failure-cards.md`; run `npm run launchbench` (definition lint + deterministic fixtures) and `npm run check:lane-coverage`. → `Start Here` step 26; `When To Load` (launchbench/failure-cards).
  2. Turn known misses into failure cards or LaunchBench scenarios (not oral lore); keep the split honest — `evals:behavioral` is the opt-in live-agent subset, not the same as `launchbench`. → `Start Here` step 26; `When To Load`.
- **Proof:** `npm run launchbench` + `npm run check:lane-coverage` pass (or active failure cards are explicit); `npm run test:validators` green.
- **Memory:** `FAILURE_CARDS.md` + `evals/launchbench/` scenarios + `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` active failure cards.
- **Stopping condition:** `launchbench`, `check:lane-coverage`, and `test:validators` all pass — readiness is claimed only on green, with any remaining miss recorded as an open `FAILURE_CARDS.md` row.

### L50 — Skill runtime sync & version discipline (maintainer)
- **Trigger:** After any skill change — bump the version, sync the installed runtime (maintainer machine only), and run the readiness gate.
- **Action:**
  1. Load `references/skill-versioning.md`; bump `skill-version.json` and pass `check:version-discipline`/`check:skill-version`. → `Start Here` step 24; AGENTS.md *Runtime Sync*.
  2. On the maintainer machine only (where `~/.codex/skills/b2c-mobile-business-launch` exists), mirror the checkout into the installed runtime, run the runtime audit, and verify the Claude/Agents symlinks; in clones/CI/cloud, skip runtime sync and use `npm run audit:ci` as the readiness gate. → CLAUDE.md (maintainer note); AGENTS.md *Runtime Sync*.
- **Proof:** `npm run check:skill-version` + `npm run check:version-discipline` pass; `npm run audit`/`audit:ci` green; runtime `diff -qr` clean where sync applies.
- **Memory:** `skill-version.json` manifest + the installed runtime copy (maintainer machine).
- **Stopping condition:** `check:skill-version`, `check:version-discipline`, and `audit:ci` all pass; on the maintainer machine `diff -qr` of source vs installed runtime is empty, else the non-maintainer skip is recorded in the work summary.

---

## Distinctness Notes (no-overlap justification)

- **L01 vs L50** — both touch `skill-versioning.md`, but L01 is the *consumer-side* freshness gate (founder asks to update before doing launch work) and L50 is the *maintainer-side* sync after changing the skill. Distinct trigger, distinct artifact (`PROJECT_STATE.yaml` decision vs `skill-version.json` bump).
- **L13 vs L14** — same Emotional Experience System references, but the producer path emits `EMOTIONAL_DESIGN.md` (design-forward) and the auditor path emits `EMOTIONAL_AUDIT.md` (Six-Lens scoring of an existing app). SKILL.md step 16a explicitly splits them.
- **L20 vs L21 vs L26** — all over `state/`, but L20 is the per-change STATE→RENDER cycle, L21 is the one-shot token→`design-system/` promotion, and L26 is *extending* the Control Plane with new panels. Separate validators (`check:design-room`, `check:token-promotion`, `check:control-plane`).
- **L27–L34** are all "store ops" but each has a distinct artifact + validator (ASO metadata, listing packet, signing, requirements/privacy manifest, console script, ASC CLI, screenshots, Play). They reconcile with each other (privacy answers, pricing) without duplicating.
- **L24 (`premium-mobile-craft`)** is folded under design but kept distinct from L22 (UX patterns / flow shape) because it owns the in-app *craft* layer and ships `PremiumCraft.swift`. `consumer-product-design-agency.md` is treated as a peer grounding reference for L13/L14 rather than its own loop (it explicitly says "do not duplicate" the emotional/quality/onboarding references), avoiding an overlap.
- **L43 vs L44** — GEO/SEO is the copy/crawlability discipline that must load *before the first file edit*; the funnel loop is the build-and-verify-the-landing-site workflow. They cooperate (`check:landing-funnel`) without sharing a trigger.

## Re-scan Result

Final re-scan of SKILL.md (`Start Here` 1–27, `Default Phase Flow` 0–6b, `Design
Room Contract`, `Autopilot Run Contract`, `Change Cascade`, `When To Load`,
`Deliverable Standard`) against the inventory:

- Every `Start Here` step maps to ≥1 loop; every loop maps back to a named
  `Start Here` step / phase / contract section, a `references/*.md` file, an
  artifact template, and (where one exists) a `package.json` validator.
- Every `package.json` `check:*` / `probe:*` / `render:*` validator is claimed as
  the **proof** of exactly one loop (or, for cross-cutting validators like
  `check:provider-proof`, owned by L07 and *referenced* by provider lanes).
- No `Start Here` step or phase is left without a loop; no two loops share the
  same trigger + primary artifact + validator (see Distinctness Notes).

**Verify/stop met:** 50/50 workflows have exactly one grounded loop; the
inventory shows full coverage with no gaps or overlaps; each loop's action steps
trace to named sections of the skill.

## Re-audit Result (stopping conditions)

After ranking the loops by stop subjectivity and rewriting the worst first, all
50 stops were re-audited mechanically:

- **Judgment terminators:** 0 remaining. A grep of every stop for `looks good`,
  `feels right`, `matches reality`, `evidence-backed`, `reconciles`, `is/are
  complete`, `seems`, `polished`, `good enough`, `until it` returns nothing.
- **Concrete anchor per stop:** 50/50. Every stop names ≥1 of — a `package.json`
  command + pass state (`check:*`, `probe:*`, `launchbench`, `audit:ci`,
  `validate:*`, `render:*`), a grep/`diff`/`curl`/exit-code/HTTP-status check of a
  named artifact, or a discrete `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` lane/gate state. A grep of
  every stop for those anchors leaves 0 unanchored.
- **Coverage of the 41 lane validators:** each `check:*`/`probe:*` script is the
  terminator of the loop that owns it; loops without a dedicated validator (L08,
  L09, L18, L28, L38, L41, L45, L46) terminate on a grep/`diff`-checkable artifact
  property plus a `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` gate, never on an adjective.

Reproduce the audit:

```bash
# (1) must print nothing
grep '^- \*\*Stopping condition:\*\*' docs/skill-workflow-loops.md \
  | grep -iE 'looks good|feels right|matches reality|evidence-backed|reconciles|is complete|are complete|seems|polished|good enough|until it'
# (2) must print nothing (every stop carries a concrete anchor)
grep '^- \*\*Stopping condition:\*\*' docs/skill-workflow-loops.md \
  | grep -vE 'check:|probe:|launchbench|audit:ci|validate:|render:|grep|diff|curl|exit 0|HTTP 200|PROJECT_STATE|lanes\.|\.md|\.yaml|asc |baseline/'
```

No loop stops on judgment.
